4,"In Deadpool 1 and 2, while powerless, Wade never speaks directly to the audience, suggesting that his ability to see the 4th wall is another part of his mutation.","In Deadpool 1, it is only the ""current"" Deadpool providing narration. During the various flashback scenes, Powerless Wade never talks directly to the audience. He does make 4th wall breaking jokes (like having the action figure of XMO:W's Deadpool) but he never actually talks directly to the camera prior to getting his mutation.

In Deadpool 2, While wearing the Power Limiting Collar, Wade never talks to the camera (though he still does make references to the MCU, making a crack that without his powers he's basically a bowless Hawkeye), instead he only talks to other characters. As soon as he gets his powers back, he immediately looks at, and talks to, the camera. Subtley suggesting that his ability to see the 4th wall is, in fact, part of his powers.",MovieDetails,1532973519,Grapz224,True,12585,240,2018-07-30
5,"In the first spongebob movie, the trench spongebob and patrick venture into actually exists",The very bottom of the sea bed is called the abyssal plain and is over 2 miles down. In the plain are trenches that stretch hundreds of miles long and go down 7 miles below sea level. This is also at a level where light does not go to so the darkened background of the scene is also accurate ,MovieDetails,1532983139,K1CK_TH3_B4SS,True,108,16,2018-07-30
6,"Shaun of the dead, hot fuzz, and the worlds end together make the cornetto trilogy","The trilogy is named such because in Shaun of the dead, Shaun always buys two cornetto‚Äôs when he goes to the store. In hot fuzz, Danny buys always buys one and so does Nicholas later in the film. Finally, in worlds end, in the end sequence where nick frost narrates the outcomes for all of his friends, a cornetto wrapper flies past his face.

""And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, ‚ÄúYou are the Son of God.‚Äù""
