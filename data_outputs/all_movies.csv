Mistake that nearly ruined Crimson Peak for me,"The movie Crimson Peak is not on Netflix and I decided to watch out last night. Pretty  spooky and atmospheric and then they get to the house in England. The house is falling apart and every time anyone walked through or near the center of the house, we see leaves falling through a hole in the roof - constantly. But then we see the outside of the house and there are no trees anywhere near the house. In fact the hill the house is on is barren due to the clay insert it AND there are no trees anywhere in the property.

Can anyone here defend the weird moral of the mini series Princess Disguise?,"In the Princess Disguise tv series from the early 2000's, (which I think is named something else in America but I can't remember what) is an episodic YA fantasy series about a teenage princess and her friends who travel around the country in disguise, having adventure and helping the people they come across. Unfortunately, in one of these books, I feel the team behind the show made a big mistake and accidentally made me side with the villains of that book. Here is why:

In the adventure (volume 4) the disguised princess comes upon a town at the edge of the woods that is being attacked by pirates. The pirates frequently steal food and gold from the town. The town is protected by a woman warrior named Branwen. The princess and her friends want to help the town, but throughout the story, the Princess keeps insisting that there are two sides to every story. Eventually, she is captured by the pirates, and she learns that the pirates are mostly teenage boys and she befriends a couple of them. The pirates are planning another attack on Branwen's town. Branwen, meanwhile, is gathering together the warriors of the town to ambush the pirates when they return. When the Princess learns this, she actually WARNS the pirates. But the pirate boys proceed anyway, insisting that they need the food and the gold - despite it not being clear why. In the final battle, the Princess and her friends actually help the attacking pirates so that the pirates aren't killed. Two scenes I hated the most:

1: One of the teenage pirates gets into a battle with one of Branwen's men, a six foot tall 26 year old man named Joseph. Joseph is a man who hates the pirates and agrees with Branwen that they should die. Joseph was standing guard outside the food storehouse of the town, when the first boy drops on his shoulders. True, the boy was just trying to distract him, but the boy is shouting and yelping happily like a drunk and slapping his hands into Joseph's chest, ripping open his shirt so his hands can ""play drums"" on Joseph's bare chest. What is Joseph supposed to do here? The boy is on his back! When Joseph throws the boy off his back and onto the ground, the boy screams in pain and we're supposed to think it's bad what Joseph did. Joseph raises his sword to kill the boy when the Princess attacks Joseph. ""HE'S JUST A BOY YOU BRUTE!!!"" Why not tell the boy not to attack Joseph? And then FOUR boys are on Joseph's back, hooting and grabbing his chest hair and pulling on it (like a horses harness) to maneuver him around town. Joseph tries to kill them again, and this is when the day is saved by dropping the tree on him. The fact that the Princess beams and congratulates the boys on teamwork is just weird.

2: Branwen is arrested by soldiers from the Princess's castle, and the Princess makes a speech about how the town and its gold belongs to both the townspeople and the pirate boys, and this is the happy ending.
Why is the Princess siding with pirates who are attacking a town instead of the townspeople? Why is Branwen, the brave woman warrior defending her home, portrayed as the villain for wanting to get rid of the pirates attacking her people? My favorite character was Branwen. The princess should have been helping her, not there pirates.",movies,1619218633,Halfcuzzin,True,1,1,2021-04-23

Spoiler for I Care A Lot. On Netflix,"Omg this movie is kinda dumb. A con artist gets in a fight, WITH THE ACTUAL RUSSIAN MAFIA AND WINS.  Not like in an action hero way either she just can’t seem to be killed (AGAIN THE RUSSIAN MAFIA). The whole movie is scened to make this woman who basically legally kidnaps the elderly to become their legal guardian. Kidnaps the mob boss’s fuckin mom, and some how isn’t immediately killed. Then she survives an actual mob hit (because plot armor). Kidnaps the fucking mob boss and for some reason he’s like “I hate you, wanna be partners?” WHICH MAKES NO GODDAMM SENCE. The whole movie I’m yelling “SHE FUCKED WITH THE MOB WHY IS SHE NOT DEAD?” If it weren’t for the fact that a guy she fucked over at the beginning walking up to her an putting a round through her lung this would be the worst movie. The ending was almost made up for the fact that the whole movies is just framed as “Big bad boss woman’s a massive bitch because life’s not fair and she’s a strong woman taking advantage of people. Root for her, not the guy who’s mother she kidnapped. Because she’s a woman, and she’s not afraid of no man.”

“I care a lot” is the female version of “pain and gain”,"Both main characters are out to “legally” have their targets sign over their properties. Both are chasing the “American Dream.” Both characters “hate to lose”/hyper competitive, are motivated, money driven. Both have failed attempted murder. Both don’t end well for the main character. Both are “comedic”. I thought both were worth no more than 1 watch although Rosamund Pike is really good at portraying a really unlikeable character.

"Looking for revenge, mind fuck, psychological thrillers, or similar movies.","I know this has been asked a million times on best of netflix sub but i dont want to limit to just netflix. Don’t really know how to put it in a genre but one of my favorite movies is Lucky Number Slevin. ****SPOILER ALERT**** If you haven’t seen it, the entire movie is one big revenge, and the main character turns out to be the young kid from the beginning, seeking revenge against the men who killed his family. I like the actors and thought it was a good blend of characters, action, humor, and one of the biggest ultimate revenges. I have seen a lot of the classics, Memento, One Hour Photo, Identity, The Usual Suspects, Seven, Split, Gone Girl, Shutter Island, The Game, Nocturnal Animals, Fatal Attraction. Liked all those. Big Ben Affleck fan so Gone Girl was really good. I also like 2 with Johnny Depp- Secret Window and The Tourist. Not sure if these all necessarily fit the bill for the genres given but I really like movies where at the end u find out something was someone or something u hadnt known, or at least wasnt positively sure of.  I do like horror also, so suggestions can definitely lean that way. English only please. I have tried to do foreign with subtitles and i just cant.

I remember seeing this movie once and liking it a lot. I think it was one of those 'made for TV' releases, but I don't know for sure. I must have seen it in late 90s/early 00s. The only thing I can remember with regards to the plot is that there was a woman who was hit by a car and had some serious issues afterwards, eg. couldn't breathe on her won. There was a scene when she was in hospital and there was a blackout so the machine she was hooked on to was not working and her sister/friend (?) was manually operating it to save her from dying.

I have questions regarding two movies: Constantine and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,"\*\*Spoilers ahead\*\*

So in Constantine, when Constantine and Kramer attempt to pray the devil's son out of the woman or whatever, near the very end of the movie. Things are looking good and then Kramer gets possessed and gets thrown around. Who just possessed him? Was that the devil's son? Like he couldn't get through the woman so he got mad and possessed Kramer to get rid of him? Just wanted to confirm this. Thank you!

As for The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo... So I have questions regarding the bible verses and names. So it appeared as though Gottfried was going through this list and then, somehow, Martin knew about the list and what finished it with Lena Anderson? How did Martin know about the list? How did Lizbeth know the list was complete? I mean I imagine there are only so many women being brutally murdered in the old testament of the bible, so I'm assuming that was all of them? Then, why was Hariot writing down those names in her bible? She just knew about a handful of the girls names, and the relevant bible verse, that her father had murdered? Lizbeth mentions Hariot was 'looking for them too', but how did Hariot even know about them? And she wouldn't exactly be 'looking for them too' would she? I mean there is no internet back then so she can't just google the women's names and how they died. So if her father never mentioned the locations, just the names and bible verses, it does seem like Hariot would have trouble figuring out more information. Especially being around 14 years old. Near the end, Hariot is talking to Daniel Craig's character about how her father would quote the bible while he raped and beat her, but didn't specifically say he told his kids about this list. Are we supposed to assume in those talks he told his kids about the jewish women he killed and the related bible verse?",movies,1619047718,FortitudeWisdom,True,1,8,2021-04-21

Can someone help me with a movie?," 

It  can be a movie or a series. It was my friend who watched it and he's  been trying to find it for about 3 years. He doesn't know if it's an old  or new movie / series. I will write what he remembers.

SPOILERS

Mother  and daughter go for a trip. They go to an amusement park that is in  another city, but to get there they take a ferry or boat. Then cuts the  scene and a detective appears. He was called because he found the body  of a girl under a stone as if someone lifted the stone and placed it  there.

Cut to mother and daughter,  they are on the boat and the energy starts to oscillate. Around the  river there is a forest and it starts to blow and darken. Everything  runs out of power and the boat stops. They paddle to the city where the  park is placed.

In that city the  exits are gone. The forest got bigger and more frightening. Then start  sending people to the forest to find a way out but they never come back.  The mother and daughter live in a hotel in the city.

Someone  gives an idea of ​​going down a manhole and there was a hole there. The  things they threw in there never reached the bottom.

Cut  to the detective and they found documents from people who doesn't  exist. They find the id of the stone girl and she has the same last name  as the detective. They do a DNA test and find out that she is his  daughter. But he doesn't remember having a family because he was single.

They  start sending children because the adults who were sent they heard  screaming. Then they send the woman's daughter through the hole and hear  no scream, just as if it were a breath. The girl daughter of the woman  is the same as the stone. He says it's like the city has disappeared  from the map.

That's all he remembers, his goal is to find out what it is, if anyone knows something like this story I would appreciate it.

Now, for squeamish viewers, this probably isn't for you. The film is jam-packed with disgusting scene after disgusting scene. But if you can handle the wild amounts of gross gore and strange scenes, you'll have a good time. (Hopefully)

The Sandlot is such a classic and great film.,"There are so many great moments in it. When they basically spend half the movie talking shit to some other kids. Or just the aspect of how it was like one day basically shaped all of their lives. 

Granted the weirdness is that at the end, it was like ""Everybody went on to live a happy successful life.. Except this one dude.. Who was obsessed with the 60's.. He just faded away.""  I tried to figure out where the ""Present"" part of the ending took place, and I came to the conclusion that it was in the 80's. Because they were kids in the 60's, and by the end of the film. They looked like they were in their 30's at least. 

I also read up on the sequels.. The 2nd film is basically a complete rehash of the first film. Instead of the main guy being Smalls. It's his younger brother, who I guess for some reason still thinks the new dog nextdoor and James Earl Jones's character is ""mean"". Which wouldn't make sense, because at the end, he basically made a deal to talk baseball with all of the kids every once in awhile. But the entire concept and plot is basically the first movie. 

Kids play Baseball, meet some new kid, ball goes into the same exact yard. They try to get it back. Find out the dog is actually nice.  Also both were directed and written by the same guy as the first film.",movies,1619054121,Randym1982,True,1,159,2021-04-21

What's the name of the movie where a carnival lets people access their dreams and the villain is hanged.,"Please help me, I've been trying to figure it out for a couple years.

I remember that the villain had an object he could put in his mouth that would allow him to survive. An old guy tricks him by putting a replica in his mouth, making the villain use the wrong one and die.

The old guy owns a traveling circus that allows people to access their desired dreams, but sometimes a guy in a suit who lets them live out their darkest dreams I guess?

The villain is introduced when the main characters find him hanged under a bridge.

One of the dreams include people climbing up towards clouds

the ending has the old man having a puppet show on the street and he sees his daughter at a café with her children",movies,1619054745,Crimgon1,True,1,7,2021-04-21
Is Jesus of Nazareth (1977) a TV series or a film?,"Interested in watching this as it’s gotten a lot of acclaim. But I’m not sure whether it qualifies as a movie or a TV show. IMDb has it as a tv miniseries, Wikipedia calls it an “epic film and television drama serial.” A bunch of reviews have mixed categories: some call it a film, others call it a tv show, others a miniseries. Which is it? The answers here will probably be as mixed as the results I’ve gotten so far but I guess it’s worth a shot",movies,1619054925,Kubrick379,True,1,5,2021-04-21

"Is anyone into foreign language films? You should watch ""Tumbbad"".","Tumbbad is an Indian horror movie released in 2018 and was the opening film of the prestigious Venice International Film Critic's Week. The heavily atmospheric film which tells us the story of a God cursed into obscurity and Vinayak our ""protagonist"" who is hungry for money and power. It is a cautionary tale for those who fall into the trap of greed. The film relies on it's atmosphere and story to deliver the scares rather than relying on jump scares. Those who like horror films which are Lovecraftian and don't rely on jump scares will enjoy this movie. The music is scored by Jesper Kyd the famous composer of games such as Hitman and Assassin's Creed. Kyd has created an exceptional fusion of Western and Eastern music to create an atmospheric soundtrack which fits the film like a glove. The film is rated 8.3/10 on IMDB and is a film worth watching at least once. The movie is available for streaming on Amazon Prime.

I was reminded of why I find so many of his projects so hard to watch.  Every single human character is 2 dimensional, and their dialogue is painful to listen to.

Which sucks, because Pacific Rim could have been really good if it had the writing to back up the kaiju and jaeger designs.

Something Bizarre I Noticed While Watching World War Z (Caution: World Politics),"In the film, when it comes time for Brad Pitt's character (Jerry?) to head to Israel, we see the country has imposed self-isolation. Israel is now surrounded, in its entirety, by a wall (not just on the west Palestinian side). The movie shows this as a good thing, as the wall has been keeping the zombies out.  
Okay, no fault there.  
We see Israel allowing Palestinians, and other Islamic refugees across their border with the use of gated tunnels. They are seen waving the Palestinian flag, praying towards Mecca, and wearing hijabs and kufi's (clearly so we can identify them as Arabs).  
Very Generous.  
But here's where it gets weird.  
After letting in a small Islamic girl, she begins to sing with her people. This singing immediately grabs the attention of the zombies, now doubling their efforts. Shortly after this, the zombies breach the walls of Israel, dooming the entire nation.  
  
So Israel was doomed by their compassion in allowance of Palestinians thru their borders.  
I know some people will see this as a stretch. Or dismiss this as a coincidence. But we all know what's currently going on in the West Bank and Israel's tumultuous relationship with Palestine. Considering the three screenwriters who wrote World War Z (as well as the original author of the book, even though the movie is far removed from the source material), the director, and 3 of the 4 producers are Jewish, I highly doubt that this could be considered a coincidence.  
  
Did anyone else find the message (intentional or unintentional) that this particular scene off-putting?  
Or is it just a big dumb zombie movie that needed an excuse to get the undead over the wall?",movies,1618884505,StuffHobbes,True,1,132,2021-04-19

Split Movie,"TW cutting
Has anyone seen the movie split? It was a movie from 2016 where one of the main characters had DID and like turns into a monster in the end. Now thinking back at that, that movies had a like dumb message, or at least for me. At the end, the “monster” spare one girl who he was going to kill because she had cut marks along her arm/back (I don’t remember it too too much) and I was just thinking about how, for me at least, what I’ve gotten from that is that you don’t understand pain or like sadness if you haven’t cut or attempted. And for me, someone who hasn’t, sometimes I feel like I don’t deserve to be sad, or am less important compared to those who have, and it’s like a dumb kinda jealously thing????

You all should give Godzilla (2014) a rewatch,"A little context about me first. I’m not much of a big blockbuster guy, and I usually stick with the A24/Annapurna brand of indie dramas and horror films. But, admittedly, I AM a sucker for monster movies, as well as classic Spielberg-style adventures. 

That being said, I saw Kong Vs. Godzilla recently and, while I didn’t hate it, I thought it was pretty underwhelming. The big action sequences were fun, but they weren’t particularly memorable. Also, the human characters were just so stupid and unbelievable that I couldn’t help but zone out whenever they were onscreen.

Anyway, my disappointment with this latest entry in the Godzilla/Kong series prompted me to give Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla from 2014 another try and, I gotta say, it’s pretty fucking awesome.

This thing is by no means a masterpiece of cinema, but what it does succeed at is a tremendous sense of scale and atmosphere. Every shot is meticulously well thought-out, opting for less “flash” and more dynamic and immersive cinematography. The way the monsters are framed is just genius, as the perspective of the camera is almost always positioned where an actual human being could stand, which makes the spectacle of watching Godzilla clash with the Mutos so much more terrifying an awe-inspiring. One of my favorite shots takes place inside of a moving bus, pointed out the windows as Godzilla collides with the golden gate.

Also, the human characters are much better than in later entries to the series. Don’t get me wrong, there are no profound character arcs to be found here. However, I found myself actually rooting for the lead (Aaron Taylor Johnson) quite a bit. The simple premise of a man desperate to reunite with his family in the midst of a massive catastrophic event gave me just enough to be invested, and that’s all a movie like this really needs. Not to mention, Bryan Cranston’s performance, while brief, is genuinely outstanding.

Basically, if you are like me and have soft spot for monster flicks, or if you are a fan of inspired blockbuster filmmaking, Godzilla is 100% worth a first or second watch",movies,1618698086,bradbradbradley,True,1,110,2021-04-17

"Wow ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) was so ahead of it's time.","I'm only 23 so forgive me for being a little late to the Space Odyssey party, it's hard to find these movies when your generation doesn't pay attention to the classics &amp; your previous generation never told you about it. After watching it I finally understand the many references from it scattered across our culture in other movies, cartoons, tv shows, etc. 

What perplexed me about it was the level of detail &amp; depth in it's visuals &amp; production. I mean what else do you expect from a Stanley Kubrick film? If you showed me this movie without knowledge of the release date, I would've guessed it came out in the 90s, early 2000s or late 80s (that is if the 60s looking character styles didn't throw you on the scent) at my earliest guess but for it being shot in the 60s I'm utterly impressed at it's production &amp; re-watch value. I might even say it's more well done than some of today's modern futuristic flicks.

I also appreciate this movie's plot &amp; slow paced journey into showing you man's evolution (at least that's how I perceive each monolith's meaning) &amp; it's warning on machine outdoing/outsmarting &amp; betraying man, everything about it seems so ahead of it's time I couldn't believe as I watched through it that it was released in '68. Sure there are some small things in it that scream 60s fantasy sci-fi but it's far few &amp; negligible to even be noticeable after a while &amp; at the end of the day seems like it tried to get away from 60s cliche as much as it could which I can appreciate.

Glad I got to see this classic gem of cinema. 

P.S. - This movie makes me wish that Stanley Kubrick directed ""Event Horizon"". This movie definitely gave me some lovecratftian vibes here &amp; there that for some reason reminded me of Event Horizon.",movies,1618700079,thepositivepandemic,True,1,10,2021-04-17

Would some people consider it racist or sexist to like old classic Hollywood movies?,"Most of them haven’t aged very well. Many of them showcase insensitive stereotypes and attitudes towards people of color and women, they’re very casual about it too. Gone With the Wind being probably the most famous example...

But in spite of that, I still really enjoy these movies. I’ve really gotten into watching them lately. Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, Bette Davis, Tyrone Power, etc. I’m currently trying to see what all the fuss is about this Greta Garbo lady...they’re all fascinating to me! As actors and as people. 

But I worry about how people today would perceive that today. That maybe I’m being insensitive by watching and mostly enjoying these films? I enjoyed Gone With the Wind and still watch it every now again—but because of Vivien Leigh’s portrayal of Scarlett O’Hara. She embodies the character so well and takes you on a journey as you watch Scarlett change and mature but then go back to being that self centered bitch again. It’s fascinating to watch!

Movies Can Change the Whole Country Like in Senegal Once,"I'm going to give you an interesting story about how powerful cinema is, how it can attract people regardless of class, and what can be done for the sake of cinema. Our story takes place in Senegal, in the 1970s.

Director Ousmane Sembène begins to work on Diolla, a language that is about to disappear, in order to shoot her new movie Emitai. He nearly works for 2 years. For the film, he needs people who can speak this language. And for that reason, he contacts the sacred forest chiefs of his village.

The Sacred Forest Chiefs says that they will not speak unless he brings them gifts. Sembene sets out with the alcohol he chooses, but drinks it on the way out of tension. The chiefs does not invite him to dinner because he comes without a gift, they says that they are offended.

Sembene, somehow convinces the chiefs. He provides all the materials for the movie. But working with chiefs and old village is very hard. In the film, the characters must wear red, but the people of the village denies that because red belongs to the chiefs. Again, Sembene somehow again convince them and they shot the movie.

He goes back to the village first after the movie is finished. Even those in the surrounding villages come to watch the movie. Many are shocked to see the cinema for the first time. After the premiere, the wise elders gather and went to the sacred forest. Even if Sembene says he want to go, they won't let him go.

On the 2nd day, the sages returns from the sacred forest and this time they gathared in the rain forest. Of course, he's still waiting. On Day 3, the returning sages reveal their ideas: They liked themselves in the film but did not like the introduction of the gods. I laughed a lot here. Probably first film critics in the Africa. I'm just kidding.

When the French attacked, the gods helped them invisibly in their resistance, this was not shown enough. Children who watched the movie get angry and even blame the old people for not resisting enough them during the war period.

Knowing the stories that spread from mouth to mouth, the children had the chance to see the resistance for the first time. Although most of them had seen cinema for the first time, they understood what was being told, inferred on it and blamed the old people. Women were satisfied with themselves.

When they ask Sembene why he was trying so hard for this movie, he says that most of the servants in Senegal are from Diolla. When the movie came out, the servants took their children and ran to the movies. Even different minorities have gone to the movie.

Thanks to Emitai, the director is very happy to be able to show Diolla's role in the resistance. After the movie, the government hastily adds Diolla language to the curriculum. Of course the director doesn't know if it's because of the movie or not; still satisfied with the situation.

One man, for the sake of telling the true heroes of the resistance, he changes the fate of many people, helps them see movies for the first time, makes them witness to history and learn the truth. It's a great story - I think - about the power and influence of cinema.",movies,1618704673,valeriiege,True,1,2,2021-04-17

RidiculousNess of fast and furious franchise,"So The fast and furious franchise is one of my favorite franchises Just because it has evolved into something so ridiculous.

It started out as a street racing movie and then it launched into a heist movie. From there we are racing on ice and avoiding torpedoes. Then we get to Hobbs and Shaw which deals with a super powered person.

It was just confirmed today that fast and furious 10 will be in space which makes no sense. And then I just read a quote from the Director of fast nine that he would not rule out a crossover between fast and furious and… Jurassic World. How far do you go with this franchise?

Bone Tomahawk (2015) Scene w/ Patrick Wilson,"I've rewatched this scene so many times, and still have no idea what is going on. First off, the first troglodyte *misses* with the arrow.. from, like, 10 feet away? Or was he just trying to scare/wake him up? (not likely)

Then when Hector O'Dwyer starts shooting the 2nd one (after killing 1st), one shot looks like it bounced off its throat or something. Then the final shot, the troglodyte throws his arm like ""fuck this, i'm grabbing my tomahawk"" after the shot is fired. 

Are they implying he missed *every* shot (minus the bow-breaker) at that range, or that the bullets 'deflected' or something weird? I think a bullet richocheted off another one's wolf skull mask after Sheriff Hunt shot him, because he was the same one ramming that tomahawk down Hunt's throat a few seconds later..

What's going on - is this trog bulletproof??

Psycho II (1983),"The first Psycho is widely regarded as one of the best horror films ever made, as well as one of the best films made by one of the greatest directors ever: Sir Alfred Hitchcock. When I first saw it, I absolutely agreed with that. 

But it wasn’t until after that initial viewing that I learned about the three sequels that existed in addition to the 1998 remake that I was already aware of. I became interested in watching them, but I never got around to it until today, when I watched Psycho II on Peacock. Unfortunately, Peacock isn’t available on my smart TV, so I was forced to watch it on my phone. Not ideal to be sure, but a pair of headphones made for a decent surround sound experience, anyway. What also made it more enjoyable is that I found this to be a very enjoyable and worthy successor to that 1960 classic.

My favorite thing about this film is how closely connected it felt to the original. Not only does the story feel like a logical progression of the first movie but, despite being made almost a quarter of a century later in color as opposed to black and white, it also looks a lot like the first one. 

Several shots are designed as direct homages to the original and the whole thing uses angles and camera placement that just look so strikingly similar to that one. It really feels like the crew took a close look at Psycho and set out not to rehash it but to tell a compelling story that remains faithful to it tonally, narratively, and visually.

Another thing that helps with this is the score. There are some blasts of 80s synth that sound quite good and blend in well, but for the most part it sticks to sharp horns and full strings that harken back to the first film’s iconic music. All of this makes it feel like you’re watching something 20 years older than it is. It’s very old-fashioned in the things I’ve mentioned.

I also really enjoyed the performances. Anthony Perkins slips right back into the titular character without missing a beat and, just as in the original, succeeds in portraying a genuinely creepy and disturbed individual that you also feel sympathy for. 

In fact, this is one area that I think the sequel improves upon the original in since Norman is most assuredly the protagonist in this, so you get more time with him. This gives Perkins the opportunity to more fully develop and expand upon his initial performance.

I’m also so glad they were able to get Vera Miles back. It shows good faith on the part of the production that they want to do justice to the first movie and they also find a really interesting direction to take her character in that I thought was pretty smart and well-done

My main problem with it is that the script and, sometimes, the performances feel somewhat stilted and unnatural. This was probably intentional with regards to Norman, and it works for him because of who the character is and how Anthony Perkins plays him. But I noticed it elsewhere too, particularly in Mary, the female lead. It’s not a huge distraction, but I felt it happened a fair bit throughout.

I also think the story was perhaps a tad too convoluted and twist-laden. I’m glad they made the effort to give a horror film a plot that you actually want and need to pay attention to, but it starts getting a bit messy and jumbled towards the end.

So, as I’m sure you expected, it’s not as good as the first. Sequels rarely are and it would’ve been next to impossible in this case without Hitchcock. I know I compared it quite a bit to that original film, but it would’ve been so easy to make this a lazy cash grab just to capitalize on the name, and I wanted to make sure I praised how much they managed to emulate the first one technically while also telling an original and unique story.

To wrap this up, I thought this was a very good companion piece to one of the greatest horror films ever, and I’m definitely looking forward to watching Psycho III and IV now (as well as avoiding that remake by any means necessary).",movies,1618529271,movieguy2004,True,1,10,2021-04-15

I remember one scene where he was mid hit aka killing someone, then had to go home to stir the collard greens for his dinner date that night. Then went back to killing or disposing of the body. 

He was just so cavalier about the whole hit man thing. It was funny. 

Anyway, anytime I see an old hit man movie I check to see if it was this one. If anyone can help me out it would be appreciated.",movies,1618531565,Tigen13,True,1,7,2021-04-15
pacific rim series could’ve been so much more...,"just revisited pacific rim the other day. was better than i expected, amazing job by del toro. every fight, i was genuinely worried about the jaegers safety, kept me captivated the whole way...

then there’s uprising. the wasted sequel. teens piloting power rangers as they kill a fat electric monster thing. hell, they even killed mako. like, are you kidding me.

pacific rim may not necessarily need a sequel. the plot of the first movie closed it all down. but there was so much potential to this idea of jaegers defending humanity against monstrous kaijus...

my point is, pacific rim could’ve been so much more. a huge franchise, a tv show, anything. but thanks to uprising, we don’t have any of that. and that makes me sad. today, i’m still hoping for a revisit, but that is unfortunately unlikely to happen. i guess that just makes the first movie all the better!",movies,1618532068,ThatGuy2931,True,1,11,2021-04-15

Please help me find the name of a film I've been trying to remember for a decade,"Some fifteen to twenty years ago my Dad and his wife watched a film whilst I, being a grumpy teenager, played Counter Strike or looked and Newgrounds, as we did in those days. I sort of loosely paid attention to the film and thought it seemed quite good. Years later a few scenes popped into my head randomly and I couldn't remember it the name of it. They didn't recall watching it. Now, once or twice a month the same scenes pop into my head and I frown and Google and ruminate to no avail. It's been at least ten years or maybe more of me trying to find this film and I finally care enough to turn to Reddit. If any of you could put me out of my misery, id be so grateful! Things I recall listed below;

- the film is about two parents who I think are either sex therapists or pioneer sex therapy in some manner
- I remember the first half of the film being quite light hearted and having some funny moments in it
- one such scene involves a man telling them he can go from being completely flacid to ejaculation in X very short time - they say this isn't possible and he immediately demonstrates and it's uncomfortable and hilarious.
- there is a scene where their daughter brings her new partner or husband to dinner with the family and she is embarrassed by how casually they discuss sex over dinner and their willingness to discuss sex of family members.
- I believe the film takes a more serious turn and the husband in some way commits himself to exploring kinks. I think for his medical journals though I can't remember.
- this causes strain on his marriage

That's it. In writing this I became aware it sounds like pornography but I'm fairly certain it wasn't and don't recall any sex scenes.

I feel like that any new Terminator film should go back to its horror roots rather than big budget action,"Even though I'm a big fan of T2 and might even prefer it to the first one. I feel like all the sequels and reboots are trying to hard to copy that large set-piece filled action movie and ditched the horror element. 

I felt like in the first film there was there this horror of an entity being sent back to specifically kill you, something that doesn't need sleep or food, something that can withstand bullets and bombs, can jump through walls or can infilitrate a club to slice your throat. That feeling of you never being safe. That feeling of something being right behind that door, ready to kill you. 

I don't feel like they incorporated any of that in the last few Terminator films. It just feels like a generic film where they only think of set pieces to put in the trailer. 

Whereas I feel it needs to be a bit more like 'It Follows' while still having enough set pieces to satisfy the crowd looking for action.",movies,1618533203,AR_Ugas,True,1,506,2021-04-15

Please help me find an animated movie I have seen in late 2000's.,"So there honestly isn't much of what I remember but from what I know... 

1) It was 3D animated.
2) Point of the movie was for a girl protagonist (around 20 years old by the looks if I remember right) to find water.  
3) The world was some sorf of a jungle environment.
4) Near or at the end she fought some sort of water goddess, which she defeated in the end. 
5) Whole movie was kinda shady. Almost like black and white only.
6) Protagonist was going up, to search for water, but in the end she was going down.
7) I also remeber her having a conversation with a male about journey being dangerous and that she should not go.

What did you get out of Your Name?,"I just watched Your Name for the first time. I broke down near the end. For me the plot wasn’t all that unique - people switching bodies/lives is a common basis for a story - but the way it was written and developed was very engaging and unique. I also watched it with subtitles and not dubbed, which may have added more engagement on my end. In these tough times to connect, it was interesting to see how these two kids connect and try to find each other. How they fall in love by really knowing and living the others life. 

Ive struggled with connection in my life, so this story gave me insight and perspective. The way it shows how two people connect and are “meant to be” was interesting. Connected through the hair tie, and this lingering feeling that they are searching for something. 

The end was such a great wrap too, with them finding each other but all the memories forgotten. Yet they still have this feeling deep down that they have met and understood one another.

My idea for how to improve the minions/despicable me franchise with one movie,"\*Before reading I am completely serious about this movie idea, I don't know where else this kind of post belongs so I'm throwing it in here and hoping it doesn't get removed\*  


Here's the Movie Idea: Okay so you remember how in the minions movie it showed serving the most despicable people throughout history, but conveniently left out the period of 1930's-1950's? Well I've an idea for a cinematic masterpiece, during this period the minions are embroiled in a civil war over who to serve between Hitler, Stalin, and Mao. This is due to the fact the minions have different opinions on how to quantify evil and thus can't unanimously decide on who they should serve. The movie would include showing the different factions of minions committing the horrendous crimes of their respective dictators. With the Nazi minions operating the concentration camps along side German troops and supervising the forced labor factories. The soviet minions shooting political dissenters, running the gulags, and supervising the starvation of whole regions. The Maoist minions would be the ones enforcing the great leap forward, imposing collectivization on the peasants, and doing the legwork of the cultural revolution. And all the while fighting each other over who was serving the most evil person, with different factions using show trials, forced confessions, and executions to enforce their views upon the other minions. While the whole movie would be very very dark, it would also enhance the comedy of the other movies in the series showing how this civil war regressed minion society through the killing off the intellectual ones leading them to decide Gru was evil since they couldn't properly quantify evil anymore. This would ultimately give the minions in the other movies a redemption arc showing how their dark past has led them down a path that would bring them back to the light. Ultimately the main conflict in the movie revolves around how we as a society quantify evil, do we base it solely on how many people died, or do we base it off a combination of the human death toll and how morally contemptible the ideology that drove the actions were? This would force the viewers to step back and think deeply about how they as an individual define evil, since the movie wouldn't provide a direct answer by showing one faction win out over the others, but would instead show the result of the minion civil war, a broken and downtrodden species searching for meaning in a world that does all it can to stomp out the kinds of people they serve.   


It's like how the muppets have kids stuff and adult stuff, this would be the adult stuff for the minions/despicable me franchise.",movies,1618377184,Colbalto,True,1,7,2021-04-13

Roald Dahl's The Witches (2020). Incredibly scary..,"This movie was fun to watch but after thinking about it more.. it's very dark.
The grandma pretty much murders a woman in her hotel room, steals her money, and grabs her contact list. Then later they commit more murders to the score of ""We are Family"" while happily taking photos. We then find out that the narrator is actually speaking to a group of child soldiers which they are training to enact the world wide genocide of a group of sentient beings.

Also imagine if the main boy character actually also died in the car crash in the beginning (with his parents). And this movie is just the imagination of a woman who lost her family and now talks to mice.",movies,1618378382,Ryner921,True,1,16,2021-04-13

What is this movie?,"Don't know if this is allowed, mods remove if not.

I'm looking for this movie that I watched around 7 years ago when I was a child. I think it an older movie. From what I can remember, it has cartoon style animation and here are the plot points I remember:

- the villain is named Don gusman and he's part of the Spanish armada

- there's a sun princess 

-a phrase that really sticks out to me from this movie is ""temple of the sun ""

-They fall over a waterfall

-theres a scene where they pass a town that's been burnt to the ground by the Spanish

- there's another scene where the villain tries to force the priest to marry him and a woman that he's kidnapped, (the woman might be the sun princess?

Babe: Pig in the City is the Mad Max: Fury Road of little pig movies. Same energy.,"I'm not just saying this because both movies are directed by George Miller. Babe: Pig in the City certainly is darker and more manic compared to the original movie. Once the story gets rolling it's all action. Intense action and a reluctant hero that helps those in need and brings them all to a better life.

It's a movie that deserves a reappraisal. Unlike Fury Road it isn't debatable if it's better than the original or not. It isn't but it's still a solid sequel that tries to be different and its own movie.",movies,1618387371,AJerkForAllSeasons,True,1,2,2021-04-14

Tom Cruise plays Cocky _______ in every movie.,"Piggybacking off a previous post can we please talk about Tom Cruise.

I know I'm late to the party so i hope this gets seen. I saw Bruce Willis (hungover underdog hero/good guy) on this list but how is Tom Cruise not #1. There will never be a more successful actor with less range. Below an abbreviated listing:

1981 TAPS: Cocky Military Student
1983 Risky Business: Cocky High Schoole
1983 All the Right Moves: Cocky Footballer
1986 Top Gun: Cocky Fighter Pilot
1986 The Color of Money: Cocky Pool Player
1988 Cocktail: Cocky Bartender
1988 Rain Man: Cocky Brother/Car Salesman
1989 Born on the 4th of July: Cocky Handicapped Veteran (Definitely his biggest stretch)
1990 Days of Thunder: Cocky Race Car Driver
1992 Far and Away: Cocky Old Times Person
1992 A Few Good Men: Cocky Attorney
1993 The Firm: "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" 
1994 Interview with a Vampire: Cocky Vampire
1996 Mission Impossible: Cocky Super Spy
1996 Jerry Maguire: Cocky Agent

It continues check IMDB and place the word Cocky before every Job title in any role he's ever played. It always works. Odd for me, as mentioned at the out set you can do the same for Bruce Willis.  Incongruently I love Bruce Willis movies and can't really stand Tom Cruise movies anymore. THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING MY TED TALK.",movies,1617835376,ranager69,True,1,58,2021-04-07

5 Bad Movies with a Good Cinematography,"Since my two lists have already irritated everyone, I have come to irritate them once again :)

1 - The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003): Actually I don't think this film is so bad, I like the atmosphere more differently, but deep down it is just a generic and predictable plot.  But the great positive comes from its sepia cinematography to represent an interior southern land.  With more yellow tones.

2 - Twilight (2008): Anyone realizes that this film is ridiculous, has the most bizarre relationship possible and all sorts of tacky dialogue.  But the first film in particular has a more artistic visual appeal, a lot due to the ambient white lighting, only drawn to colder tones perhaps to represent the vampires, and that rainy city.  After that the visuals became more rustic until it became something much more generic.  The first film still has a more authorial mark.

3 - The Beach (2000): Boyle disappointed me in this, especially since I saw this movie immediately after Trainspotting.  And the film at the beginning is good, very interesting and captivating, but after (SPOILER) the characters arrive on the island, the film totally decays, taking the story to a meaningless place and not knowing which tone to choose.  But paradisiacal cinematography is priceless.

4 - 50 Shades Of Dark (2015): This is a Twilight without a vampire and with more adult people, although it is very funny.  But the look is at least very faithful to the proposal and the one that best takes it seriously, because it has very soft shades of gray with yellow.

5 - The Incredible Hulk (2008): This Hulk film is interesting, because it adopts something more adult and serious, the script cannot express itself so much with this, but photography does. Working a lot with very dark and simpler scenarios, making more catastrophic action sequences and making several very good plans.",movies,1617836465,JayDinnerClub,True,1,58,2021-04-07

Unfortunately after searching for a few hours I haven't been able to find a specific movie or reference to any movie with the clip I need.  So I'm refferring to reddit

Now, for the first time, Sergio Leone's original uncut version of this monumental epic can be seen. The picture itself is as big as its Monument Valley locations, as grand as its fine, distinguished cast, as tough and bawdy as every kid imagines the Old West. Henry Fonda plays the blackest character of his long career, and he's utterly convincing as Frank, the ruthless murderous psychopath who suffers no conscience pangs after annihilating an entire family. Jason Robards is the half-breed falsely accused of the terrible slaughter. Charles Bronson plays The Man, who remembers how his brother was savagely tortured. Brilliantly directed by Sergio Leone, this glorious picture re-established the Western'' significance to cinema art.""

I just finished watching Cinderella Man for the 15th time at least. This story is incredibly inspiring and this movie will never not make me cry.,"I'm in no way a movie critics or connaisseur, but in my opinion this movie is very very good. The story is perfect. The actors are doing a really good job. The boxing scenes are well filmed and overall it seems pretty realistic (I've boxed for a few years and been in the ring a couple of time myself).

I recommend this movie to everyone. As a grown ass man, I'm not ashamed to say this movie makes me cry like it has no rights to every single time.",movies,1617839857,DrBRSK,True,1,10,2021-04-07

Steve Buscemi vs. Tom Cruise,"Took a little of flack for a previous post disparaging Tom Cruise for playing the same character and having little to no range. Was presented with a number of valid exceptions while still feeling strongly that his range is weak. Many of the comments mentioned that he leans into this image and that his looks have created this persona. 

Then, with acceptance of Tom Cruise's significance, is Steve Buscemi a better actor? Does he have more range? My original point wasn't about success it was  about ability.",movies,1617839921,ranager69,True,1,27,2021-04-07

Oblivion (2013) is one of the creepiest scifi films I have ever seen.,"This is a a great flick full of suspense and unnerving energy permeating throughout the whole movie. To me its is actually a psychological thriller as it creeps one out right from the start.

It has cloning, it has human enslavement by Machines (AI god type thing) and it has human resistance as its main theme.

Coudl you imagine a future where the everything collapse, the moon is broken in half and few survivers are oppressed and live in fear of drones?

What amazed me is that some ot it is within the realm of possibility on a ling time scale - maybe in 500 years the scenario is possible. Obviously the moon will still be there, but given humans self destructive tendencies and greed of hypercapitalism - we may just but AI in charge to run the show. Sure a human will be the face of a company, but its operations will be largerly AI and machine driven.

This is a great flick, have seen it when it came out at the cinemas I continue to watch it once every few years. Also, I am not a Tom Cruise fan but he always gives it his best in every scene here like he always does.",movies,1617848665,momoajay,True,1,67,2021-04-07

"Modern trailers always give away too much, and I can't watch them anymore.","I've found that I basically have to avoid any trailers for movies that I intend to see. There's a couple reasons for this.

1) 4 or 5 prerelease trailers of 3-4 minutes length end up showing probably about 7 minutes of actual movie scenes.  
2) Scenes chosen for trailers are often the funniest, most intense, etc. and thus give away what should be cool reveals.  
3) Trailer scenes can even ruin scenes that aren't shown in the trailers. i.e. The trailer had a scene with this character that hasn't happened yet so this character can't die here.

Why Aren't There More Movies about Pirates?,"I know that Pirates of the Caribbean exists and it's great. Or was great. Eventually it got to be too much about skeletons, gods, hell, mermaids, squidmen, burning beards, ships in bottles and whatever the 5th one is about. IMO the best part of the series wasn't the skeletons or that stuff, it was seeing pirates on screen in all of their swashbuckling awesomeness!

Am I the only person who finds that sort of adventure exciting? Historically, they have such a range of personalities and motives that there is potential for some genuinely amazing stories to tell there. And there is a huge source to draw from for historical dramas. It seems like there could be multiple series based on pirates!

Is it too expensive to make?

Is it too hard to film?

"Under the North Star part I and II (2009, 2010)... anyone seen those two movies? Or the original movie ""Here, Beneath the North Star"" from 1968. I've stumbled upon these Finnish movies just recently after I've watched ""The Winter War"" and ""The Unknown Soldier"" which are quite famous not only in Finl","... not only in Finland but worldwide.

 ""Täällä Pohjantähden alla"" is the original movie name. I've never thought I would enjoy them both so much! They show the destiny of one Finnish family which has transformed marshland into arable soil. Not only they have to fight the harsh climate, but also the oppression from their land borrowers, the parsonage. Their sons are participating in the uprising of the common folk, fighting serfdom and for civil rights and liberties. Later on, the third generation fights even in the Second World War against the Russians. In the end, they can keep the land and the rights of ownership are transferred to them, but all their sons have fallen in the war. It is a very sad story displaying the realities of Finnish history. If you haven't seen it yet and get the opportunity, I would highly recommend you go watch it.

It's also noteworthy that it is a book adaptation from Väinö Linna and the movie might seem a bit rushed compared to the book. Surely wasn't easy to stuff the whole material of the book into two movies.",movies,1617665059,LiveWithPatienceAndC,True,1,0,2021-04-05

Kinda like a zombie movie. 

I'm pretty much making this up as I go along but anyway. So for the plot I guess it's about a dog who was born into a world where humans have been wiped out by mutated animals of some sorts and his pack was killed except for him, because he was chasing a rabbit or something and he ends up having to fend for himself

He goes on a journey to find a new pack while having to avoid being killed by one of these mutated animals. There'd also be no dialogue whatsoever.",movies,1617670984,LeviAckerwoman,True,1,24,2021-04-05

It's comprehensively insane to think that they wouldn't have had any issues whatsoever with how we were destroying the earth and everything (else) that lives in it.

Yeah, it's from 1989, when climate change wasn't exactly readily available as an option for (political/moral) virtue signalling, but enough people were certainly aware of the issue already that it obviously should have been considered when writing the alien characters.

The Poetry of Ron Shelton: Subversion and swapping of gender roles and sexism in Bull Durham,"In talking with friends about Bull Durham, I've realized not everyone saw the film I saw. So I thought I'd lay out a few points here that back up my idea that the beloved baseball movie is really about sex, how it subverts gender norms and avoids the usual stigma regarding femininity and masculinity by rejecting sexist views of both women *and* men.

I've highlighted a few instances worth looking at with this perspective.
____

1: Annie Savoy: The High Priestess of Baseball
=

[We start first with Susan Sarandon's character, Annie Savoy, and her opening monologue.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECnlL4RY8PQ)

First and foremost the film introduces her as a woman with a philosophical dedication to a sport. Her opening speech conveys an expertise and religious devotion to baseball, an appreciation usually reserved for male characters.

Next she tells us that she chooses a different baseball player to sleep with every season. And she tells us this proudly, with no inkling that someone might judge her to be promiscuous or that promiscuity might be wrong. But Annie isn't having sex explicitly for pleasure, it is in service of the team.

&gt;There's never been a ball player slept with me who didn't have the best year of his career.

She can do this because, she says, ""making love is like hitting a baseball. You just gotta relax and concentrate."" She's great at sex and that makes her great at teaching men how to play baseball. But it's not explicitly the sex, it's the intimacy that sex provides, which allows her to introduce ideas to men who wouldn't ever oblige normally.

&gt;Sometimes when I've got a ball player alone, I'll just read Emily Dickinson or Walt Whitman to him, and the guys are so sweet they always stay and listen. 'course a guy will listen to anything if he thinks it's foreplay.'

What's remarkable is that this is all done so poetically it's almost easy to miss the fact that a woman in a film is talking about sports and sex just like a man would. She doesn't make any attempt to justify her sex life, and talks about it like she would have no need to justify herself in the first place.


_____

2: [Millie isn't ""a piece of ass""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQctJ2SOWP4)
=

The theme of sex is driven home even further when our hero pitcher Ebby ""Nuke"" LaLoosh (Tim Robbins) gets caught having sex in the locker room with Annie's protege, Millie, when he should be out on the field getting ready to make his professional debut.

The coach comes in while they're having sex and yells Ebby's name. In any other movie the two having sex immediately get scared and cover up. Not in Bull Durham. 

Ebby (as he is called at this point) continues his play with Millie for a moment or two, and then pulls his pants up—but not because he's trying to hide his bare ass, he pulls them up because it's time to stop having sex and go play ball. There's no shame in him, and there's nothing in the coach's demeanor that shows Ebby should be ashamed for being caught.

Rather, the coach's disapproval is that Ebby is showing a lack of concern for baseball, all for ""a piece of ass."" This line is one of only TWO that objectifies or shames the women in the film, and the accusation is resoundingly rebuked by Millie herself, who, just like Ebby, isn't at all concerned with being caught having sex, and has no problem addressing the coach in her underwear.


______

3: [What Crash Believes, and the Sexism in Annie's brand of Feminism](https://youtu.be/mn5crhTusSA)
=

One of the great speeches in film comes when Annie sits down Ebby and Crash Davis to discuss with them who she should have sex with for the season. Again, she's very matter of fact and dispassionate about the whole thing. 

To Annie, whomever she chooses will be more than happy about it because, as she has informed the two men, sleeping with her will make them a great baseball player. Her reasoning is predicated on the notion that men don't associate emotion with sex.

Crash stands in direct opposition to that reasoning. He immediately objects and challenges her right to choose, which Annie defends by going on a spiel about how nobody truly gets to choose because it all comes down to science and the invisible forces of the universe. Crash then tells her he doesn't believe in quantum physics when it comes to matters of the heart.

This shows us that Crash has a traditionally feminine view of sex as a matter of the heart, while Annie takes a masculine approach by not associating sex with emotion at all. And if that wasn't clear enough, she tries to assure Crash that she won't fall in love with him, notably ignoring the idea that Crash might fall in love with her.


____

Extras
=

These themes come in and out throughout the film, but here are a few notable examples of gender-bending or subversion.

- [The Mound Visit](https://youtu.be/diX4myfR6vU)
---

Notable in that it shows these men having real life concerns while in the middle of playing a sport, just one of the many pieces of authenticity Ron Shelton adds to the film through his experience playing minor league baseball. It is also the only time any of the players remark on Millie's promiscuity, specifically that's she's a promiscuous woman about to marry a devoutly religious man, and Crash shuts down any shaming of her immediately.

- [The Rose Goes On the Front](https://youtu.be/1Vcm0H62vOk)
---

Annie has Nuke wear a garter while he is pitching as a way of keeping one side of his brain occupied while pitching.

When Crash finds Nuke trying to put it on before the game, he gives him a slap on the ass and tells him it looks hot. When Nuke justifies the garter as a part of Annie's methodology, Crash agrees with her reasoning and ends the scene by telling Nuke that the ""rose goes on the front.""

- Don't Fuck With the Streak
---

I can't find a video for this but when Nuke is on a winning streak, he stops having sex with Annie. Annie eventually gets frustrated and tries to seduce him, saying that having sex or not having sex has nothing to do with winning baseball games. 

This causes Crash to confront her, pointing out that of all people Annie would understand that if you think not having sex is helping you win baseball games, then not having sex is helping you win baseball games. By either not realizing this or ignoring it, Crash exposes Annie's motivations as selfish, and her dispassionate view of sex as nothing more than a barrier preserving her emotions—again, something we are only ever shown in men.


- Do I Deserve To Wear White?
---

Annie is helping Millie fit her wedding dress. Millie asks Annie if she deserves to be wearing a white dress as it symbolizes virginity. Annie responds telling her, ""We all do.""

- Crash's Vulnerability
--

In one of the final scenes when Crash has finally left baseball as a player and come back to Annie, he asks her if he'd make a good manager (something that is obvious both to her and to us.)

Annie gets almost choked up seeing him question something that is so plainly obvious, and begins going into all the rational explanations for why he would make an excellent manager, but Crash stops her, and says she has all the time in the world to explain why, but for now he wants her to ""just be.""",movies,1617673521,Ayy_2_Brute,True,1,5,2021-04-05

Carnival of Souls is a mood today. Great B&amp;W horror film,"Not as great as Night of The Living Dead but definitely a unique movie viewing experience. There was a scene, where the creepy guy slowly comes out of the water and I immediately linked it to Dawn of the Dead (1978).

The main actress playing Mary Henry is absolutely gorgeous. Large eyes and a striking nose. Looks like Audrey Hepburn in some shots and her acting is pretty good.

Soviet Film Links,"There was recently a super popular post about a Soviet adaptation of The Lord of the Rings, and I didn't want people to look at that and think that that's representative of Soviet nor Russian cinema.

[The original Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/05/soviet-tv-version-lord-of-the-rings-rediscovered-after-30-years) presented it as a ""Soviet"" adaptation, and while technically, the Soviet flag still flew, it had basically disintegrated in 1990 when a bunch of the republics had declared ""independence"". By 1991, much of everything had already fallen apart economically, politically, and culturally, so using a film from 1991 and calling it ""Soviet"" is fairly misleading. (Neither is it really a good example of Russian cinema from that era, even though there was plenty of crap produced.) Writing this article that focuses on this unknown movie is like writing an article about the Star Wars Holiday Special.

For a better representation of Soviet cinema, check out the [Mosfilm](https://www.youtube.com/c/MosfilmRuOfficial/playlists) and [Lenfilm](https://www.youtube.com/user/LenfilmVideo/playlists) production companies' Youtube channels. They have a bunch of Soviet films, some of which have English subs (especially the Mosfilm one, which has a playlist with movies with English subs). These are mainstream films that were extremely popular in the USSR and are still very popular in Russia. Many of them have shaped people's childhoods and are quoted/referenced frequently, especially the comedies.

Sidenote about the original Guardian article: I was amused by the two paragraphs that speculated about why LOTR hadn't been translated into Russian (the reasons being censorship and the book's language being ""too complex""), as there was no acknowledgment that perhaps translators didn't think readers would have any interest in a work of fantasy that is predominantly a construction of an English ""mythology"". I wonder why Russian SciFi and Fantasy aren't frequently translated into English...? Censorship in the West?

"Aliens is and remains to be one of the greatest, sci-fi movies of all time","I recently purchased Aliens in 4K, and not only does it looks like it was filmed yesterday. God Dann that movie is good. It’s got the 80’s nostalgia whilst remaining relevant and timeless. It has what I didn’t realise until now a very strong emotional theme, the relationships with the characters. The depth of the story.  It’s ability to keep on you on the edge of your seat whilst lulling you into thinking it’ll be okay for just a few minutes. The photography is incredible, the characters have depth, and above all ur is absolutely terrifying. Not sure why writing this and I’m sure there are plenty of other posts like it.

My predictions as of right now:

- The Tree of Life cracks the top 100

- There Will Be Blood will move at least 40 spots up

- Vertigo will remain at number 1

- In The Mood For Love cracks the top 15",movies,1617488766,ayubnor,True,1,19,2021-04-03

The clock is ticking for the unfortunate person whose body he is using (this could be a female?) as there is a time limit for the experience.

It’s about a lot of things, including love, religion and more, so don’t bother looking up the plot. It’s very acclaimed but really, more people need to see this masterpiece of a film, just maybe not with your parents.

I just watched Godzilla vs Kong I HIGHLY recommended,[removed],movies,1617489722,Blades_Matt_YT,True,1,1,2021-04-03
What is the most average franchise?,"After watching Godzilla vs. Kong I'd say pretty much the Monsterverse as a whole. The closest one I'd call good is Kong: Skull Island and even then the 70's aesthetic and tributes and Samuel L. Jackson and John C. Reilly's performances just barely rise it above ""well it had cool monster fights but the movie as a whole was pretty forgettable"". The closest one I'd call bad is King of the Monsters because of how dumb the humans were in that movie but it still had ""boom boom smashy smashy monster stuff"" that was fun so it was watchable. Godzilla 2014 was actually really lacking in that department but it wasn't terrible, again, just forgettable.

So overall the Monsterverse is...okay. Some movies in that universe are better than others but, unlike the DCEU or MCU where most of the movies are average but there's a few gems and/or terrible movies in the mix, there's nothing that really stands out as especially good or especially bad.

Looking for a movie.,"Jus finished watching cast away.This one was an emotional rollercoaster for me. I dunno..I am afraid. I don't think I would be able to deal with this whole post breakup/ seperation awkward meetings and other bull crap.  I live in a place where divorce rates are pretty low, and here when we reach a particular age two families meets formally and discusses the possibility of a future alliance, most men don't even get to fuck different women and vice versa, the only women with whom a good gentleman ( who won't do anything against the wishes of his parents ) gets to sleep with is his wife, and the live happily till they die , and in most cases neither of them cheats, I like this system very much and I would only marry ( most prolly I ain't gonna marry) a virgin and I won't loose my virginity either , before marriage , Ill never betray the girl whom I am gonna marry, post or prior to marriage, that's a vow I took . 

But lately I have been very observant , I discovered that things are changin around here and people, when they reach college , gets into physical relationship and  if that goes downhill then they try their luck again with other folks from maybe their workplace and end up marrying someone else.  I cannot hold myself from falling for someone and I am pretty damn sure that it's entirely up to her to decide whether or not she wants to continue with me, if she breaks up with me then Ill be doomed, cause I wouldn't able to marry anyone, like I said I am very emotional , I didn't even twitch while watchin the combo scenes in cast away, I jus sat there straight faced, tears rollin down my face.
I know this might have triggered some of you folks ,but I don't wish to hide anything, I am transparent.

I wanna watch more movies in which , because of some reason the lovers gets seperated and the female/ male ends up marrying someone else, and then the awkward post seperation shitty emotional meeting scenes.. the helplessness of the one who got fucked  and the unconcerned / indifferent behaviour of the partner ( either male or female) who decided to move on always makes me emotional and  I like the whole experience and this might sound bizarre but I like crying. I like crying very much. So if you have ever watched a movie with a similar plot, do leave a comment below.",movies,1617493896,Jingochauver357,True,1,9,2021-04-03

I used this film, directed by Gareth Evans, because he really knows how to direct action. Gareth and the directors of the John Wick franchise are the ones in Hollywood that really know how to pull crazy stunts and do amazing work with action.

The Raid films are really good and will please anyone who like martial arts.

I have a passion for films and I aim someday to become a filmmaker.

Anyone seen A Shock to the System (1990)?,"I just happened upon this movie on HBO max. I saw it had Michael Caine so I went ahead, having never heard of it. The movie certainly looks dated, and the soundtrack is as well, but I was nonetheless captivated by it. The fact that I’d never known of its existence certainly added a bit, but Michael Caine is so god damn good in the movie as well. It’s far from perfect, especially as he’s really the only fleshed out character in the movie maybe besides Stella, but I still would say the movies underrated. I’d recommend the movie especially given its short run time of 1 hr 30 mins. 
It’s basically American Psycho but with Michael Caine. It’s not an all time classic but like I said it’s worth watching.

Or if it wasn't the zeitgeist, was it just that there was a trendsetting movie that used ballad as theme song, which subsequent movies have then followed?

Bad News Bears,"My ★★★★★ review of The Bad News Bears on Letterboxd https://boxd.it/1LHXMP

Some of the best sports movies end with the protagonist(s) losing. A few come to mind immediately like Rocky, Bull Durham, Cool Runnings, or The Big Lebowski.

The inherent lesson is that sometimes you lose, and what's important is not to win, but to try.

The Special Olympics has a motto, ""Let me win, but if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt."" I think this is a beautiful sentiment and as a life-long fan of the Chicago Cubs I know a thing or two about how it feels to root for a team of loveable losers.

Which is why The Bad News Bears holds a special place in my heart, name similarities notwithstanding.

Watching this today, at the outset of Baseball Season, that ever-hopeful time of year when the grass is freshly mown and the crowd gathers to share beer and brats, when kids in baseline seats hope to snag a few foul balls, I was struck by how universal the love of the game is.

I don't follow my team closely anymore, I don't keep up with stats or rosters, but if the opportunity arises I will never turn down an opportunity to spend an afternoon in a roaring stadium.

Bad News Bears represents for me a crossover of passions. I played little league and while I wasn't that great (and if we're being perfectly honest I could have put in a little more effort and hustle), I was the king of walks, being so short that pitchers couldn't figure out my strike zone. I also spent a lot of time in front of the TV on weekends watching movies. Whenever The Bad News Bears came on WGN Saturday Movies I was there, glued to the screen.

Other than being at a game, I can't think of a better way to spend a Saturday afternoon...",movies,1617500246,MaximusGrandimus,True,1,6,2021-04-03

Pet Semetary-worse in nearly every way and the most pointless remake I've ever seen,"Let me get two complaints out of the way.  First, King still has a ton of untapped material (e.g., The Long Walk) that could be riveting onscreen.  Second, Pet Semetary could be revisited in another way (e.g., Judd as a child or a new family falls prey to the seductive potential of the Pet Semetary).

Now onto what I feel is the most pointless remake that I've ever seen.  I don't understand why the director made this to begin with?  There was no new vision for the film.  Details below, but they cut out a poignant scene, the acting was subpar, the conclusion was weaker, redundant scenes fell far below the original, and the list goes on.  I just don't see why they made this?  Profit?  Good luck with that.  Making it accessible to new fans?  Re-release the original.  You could add scenes or touch it up and it would have been a far better experience.

Onto the detailed analysis:

**The good**: Being as kind as I can, the cat was better in this version.  Creepy, unsettling, menacing.  The cat was better than the original.  Second, the addition of the kids marching to the Pet Semetary was a good scene and could have been added to the original.  Third, Ellie's ballet scene post-mortem was creepy and scary and brilliantly filmed.  Truly, that ballet scene was the only truly standout moment of the film.

**The bad**: I love acting.  I love good acting by children even more.  This movie was horrendous in the acting department.  I've never seen so much ""phoned in"" performances by accomplished actors and wooden performances by new actors since The Last Airbender.  The child actors of the original were phenomenal.  Gage was every bit as chilling as in the book.  ""First, I played with... and now I want to play with you."" Holy shit.

This move was god-awful.  **Bad acting**: I literally winced at the delivery by Gage at one point.  Judd says ""I know who Winston Churchill was"" and she steps on his line with a robotic ""wow, you must be old"" it was less believable than a cat coming back from the dead.  They hired the right girl for the zombie, stone-faced, non-emotional portion of the film because she just had to be herself (no offense to the girl actor, she may have been the victim of the script/director).  

Even John Lithgow, who I consider to be an incredible actor with serious range (e.g., from Third Rock to Dexter) gave a b-list actor level of effort.  There was no believability behind his bonding with Ellie, is empathy for the father, his regret at the cat trying to hurt Gage, and--again--I literally winced at his ""look of relief"" before having his Achilles tendon cut.  I'm sorry, but you know someone is trying to kill you.  You know that the cat is hellspawn that is evil and intending harm on the living.  You are truly fighting for your life, see the hellspawn, and smile wistfully to yourself as though everything is okay after hearing non-cat noises travelling around your house?  No, Lithgow should have passed on this film.  Moreover, Fred Gwynne was such a stellar Judd that no one could fill those shoes again (think Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark).  But, if you wanted to try, John Lithgow was NOT the older actor to go with.

And, the wife, holy crap the acting was scarier than her sister.  I didn't sense any of the true pain, tormented history, internal conflict that Denise Crosby conveyed.  Crosby was dedicated to the craft and it showed in every scene.  I'd be unsurprised if the actors in this remake were all related to the director and this was the result of nepotism.  

**Worse narrative**: The removed the coffin scene and the fight with the parents.  Terrible.  Pascow wasn't convincing nor was the dedication of the father as palpable.  Him walking through Pascow in the original and Pascow's desire to stop him were far more salient in the original.  The ending of the original was a better conclusion, this one's ending was like a art student's ""gotcha, so menacing"" ending when the original was superior.  The monologuing by the post-mortem Ellie was ridiculous, too.  The special effects dumping on the twisted up sister was overboard as was her death.  The original was vastly superior in \*every\* way.  I still consider the original Zelda's threats to her sister among the scariest scenes I have observed and it traumatized me (saw it at a drive in and was afraid to get out of the car).  This was Pet Semetary through a cheesy b-horror movie lens rather than a gut-wrenching non-stop tension-fueled dreadful, but incredible experience that was the original (that also was faithful to King's novel).  It's kind of comical that the one ending that King gets right, and the director bastardizes it.

I could keep going on because this was not the product of passion nor respect and surely couldn't have been profit-driven so I don't understand the ""why"" of it in the first place.  Why would someone remake a movie that was so good, but downgrade the acting, storyline, final scene, emotionality, horror elements, and everything else?  Just to showcase the creepier cat?  If the original didn't exist, this would be a reasonable 6/10, but the original forces this one down to a 3/10 by comparison.  My childhood was beaten worse by this than by Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull.  I hated it and everything about it--aside from meow meow.",movies,1617501854,JoshTheBear_,True,1,64,2021-04-03

Big Trouble Little China and the Three Storms,"!!!!WARNING: SPOILERS!!!!  (Currently the movie can be watched for free on YouTube.)



In the first quarter of the movie, Jack and his friend Wang are in the truck and are just coming upon a turf war between two warring gangs, the Chang Sing in yellow turbans (and white robes due to a funeral procession) and the Wing Kong in red turbans who ambush them with firearms.

The Chang Sing who most would identify as the good guys (plus Wang says it as so), begin to take control of the situation.  However the Three Storms of Thunder, Wind and Lightning (I am sure everyone thought Raiden.) come into the scene and begin the massacre of everyone.

At the appearance of the Three it appears that the Wing Kong are just as afraid of these demi gods as the Chang Sing and they all just sort of huddle together, while trying to back away.  It is at this point that Jack floored the gas and tries to escape the chaos and their possible premature death.  Shortly after that, they come full circle and you see the Three Storms dealing with only the Chang Sing in the camera view at least.

We know later that the Wing Kong are the henchmen of the same organization of the Three Storms.  But at this very moment, as a new person watching, you most likely did not know that.

My question is, why didn't the Wing Kong take advantage of the situation.  Why were they deathly afraid of the Three Storms if they were essentially on the same side?  They were not afraid to cheat and ambush the funeral procession at first with automatic weapons to begin with.  Why not settle the score right then and there with the advantage of the Three Storms present?

Or are they equally afraid of the three demi gods who may just as likely kill them in the process if they got in their way, even if fighting the same enemy?  Or was this an over sight in production?  Maybe meant to confuse the viewer and to make them seem like totally unrelated?

Again the camera angle when Jack and Wang come full circle in the street\alleyway without their truck, you only see the Three Storms fighting the last remanents of the Chang Sing (the yellow turbans).  But could the Three Storms already killed some of the Wing Kong as well?  Or they all ran leaving their enemy, who they were basically hugging moments before, to their doom?

We know some of the Wing Kong who were present initially at the turf war, mainly the two or three better known actors are alive later.  But we have no idea of their underlings.  We do see a few dead Red Turbans on the ground at the feet of the Three Storms, but they could of been at the hands of the Yellow Turbans moments prior.

I have always been curious about this scene.  This was long winded, but thank you for those who took the time to read and give feed back.  And again, currently the movie can be watched for free on YouTube.",movies,1617316614,DS9B5SG-1,True,1,12,2021-04-01

Godzilla (2014),"I wanted to rewatch all the WB MonsterVerse films before going to see Godzilla vs. Kong, so naturally I started with the first one: Gareth Edwards’ Godzilla. I watched this a few years ago but I didn’t remember much about it other than not caring for it. In short, my past self was right.

The main criticism I hear of this is that Godzilla isn’t in it enough. This is something I adamantly agree with. You see glimpses of him a few times throughout Act II but you don’t really see him in full until the last 15 minutes or so and he definitely doesn’t do anything until then. That’s the problem with all the monsters in this. It almost feels as if they are being deliberately held back from the audience’s view. Anytime any of them are about to do something cool, the film either cuts or in one case literally closes a door on an epic fight about to ensue.

It also suffers from very poor cinematography. The colors are really dull and muted with no vibrancy at all. It’s also unacceptably dimly lit. I watched this on a 4K TV and I still had to pay close attention 30-40% of the time just to tell what was going on. Granted. I was watching a rental DVD from my local library, but a professional cinematographer should still know how to make a movie look presentable under those circumstances.

Now, some critics said that this movie focuses too much on human characters, which it does. But that would at least be tolerable if those characters were interesting. But they aren’t. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is decidedly bland as the lead while his co-star Elizabeth Olsen is completely wasted in a useless supporting role. And while Bryan Cranston is entertaining in the right circumstances, even he’s given nothing to work with here and is &gt;!dismissed at the end of Act I, unable to leave any sort of impression.!&lt;

So, is there anything redeemable here. Well, yes. Despite most of the characters being very boring, Ken Watanabe is quite good as a scientist who seems to be the only one who truly understands Godzilla. He’s easily the best human character and he probably should have been the lead, frankly. And when Godzilla finally does appear, it is quite entertaining. His CG work is done well and his scenes feature some nice sound design.

So, yeah, not a fan of this. Next on the list is Kong: Skull Island, which I have seen and enjoy a lot, so it’ll be a nice change of pace. (I’m 100% Team Kong by the way.) After that is Godzilla: King of the Monsters, which I haven’t seen but which looks like it has to be better than this if for no other reason than it actually has some color and visibility in it.",movies,1617317886,movieguy2004,True,1,9,2021-04-01

Se7en (1995) is a fantastic movie where the villain wins,"I recommend you watch Se7ev from 1995. It's a masterfully done movie with Gordon Freeman and Bradd Pitt.

It's one of those movies where the villain wins. I think that making the ending be sad was a very good decision. From the start, you can sense that this isn't a story that's going to end happily.

Thanks to that, the ending is way more heartbreaking. Both Gordon Freeman's and Bradd Pitt's characters are going to be scarred for life

This movie convinced me that movies with sad endings are often better than with good endings. With a good ending, i a often left with a feeling of unfulfillment. Bad endings help make the story more profound and hard hitting.


It's disappointing not many movies are bold enough to go for a fully sad ending. Unfortunately, most directors and producers simply aren't brave enough for that.",movies,1617318524,Victorian_Poland_2,True,1,5,2021-04-01

I like more serious dramas with good story telling or mystery/murders plots and don’t mind rewatching films either! 

Not a huge sports or action person (#sorry) 
But I do like some adventure movies 

I have Hulu, Netflix, hbo max and starz, Willing to pay for movies too!

THE VANISHING (1988) is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen!!!,"I just love a good, well-crafted thriller and this one was such a treat to watch. I remember starting to watch it like 10 years ago but turning it off after the first scene, perhaps because I was younger and didn’t have the patience for it. In a way, I’m so glad I didn’t see it then because it feels like such an undiscovered gem for me!

I’m sure I’m way late to the party on this but I just wanted to recommend it to anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. It’s definitely a quiet thriller, but so suspenseful and terrifying in a very realistic way, and without any blood/minimal violence. It shifts timelines/character POV and reveals key information much earlier than you would expect, making it even more suspenseful and even darkly comical as you go forward. There’s also really interesting philosophical ideas about fate and obsession. There’s probably more I’ll catch on my next viewing which I’m really looking forward to.

I recommend you don’t look at any reviews/trailers about it going into it! Also there’s a remake made by the same director that I’ve heard is really bad (haven’t seen it yet) so make sure to watch this one first!

The only negative thing I would say about it right now is that music at times feels a bit dated. 🤷🏽‍♂️

Just experienced 'Tarzan' (1999) and it is as good as Infinity War,"Okay, so firstly, Mark Mancina and Phil Collins absolutely nailed the soundtrack. Some of the most moving and beautiful songs I have heard.

The animation is incredibly fluid and full of life and motion. Nothing is really stationary, and everything just flows like water.

The character designs are classic Disney but also it's own thing.

Some sad moments and lovely moments, namely the ones involving Tarzan and his mother and Kocheck.

The ending luckily was the one I wanted and I will be keeping this in my physical collection. I have never seen this movie until now, and this is during peak Disney in the 90s. I will skip the Communist Party of China's Mulan and watch the animated one with Eddie Murphy. Heard that's a classic too!

Please recommend a good ensemble drama from last 3 or so years.,"I’m looking for good ensemble dramas similar to Dan In Real Life, The Ice Storm, The Big Chill or The Family Stone. I seem to love movies about family or friend groups getting together for a weekend or vacation or some event where drama ensues. 

We tend to watch a lot of movies which is why I’m suggesting recommendations from the past 3 or so years. Seems like the streaming services are cranking out a lot of material so there’s a good chance a lot has slipped by us. We have most services. And we’re not overly critical.

"Now that the Monsterverse may be complete, how do you rank the movies?","The Monsterverse may be complete, I thoroughly enjoyed all of it, but let’s talk about it!

Which movie did you like the most? Least? Why?

For me:
1. King of the Monsters
2. Kong Skull Island
3. Godzilla
4. Godzilla v. Kong

I think the sheer scale of of KOTM really takes it for me, I thought it was truly awesome, in the true sense of the word.

Of course I enjoyed the fight scenes in Godzilla v. Kong, but Mechagodzilla as an enemy felt so rushed, like much of the last movie.

Nevertheless, if the Monsterverse doesn’t continue (&amp; I hope it does! I’d love some prequels) I think it was a good enough send off.

I don't think these Disney+ shows are going to last long.,"Let me start by saying I'm a huge fan of the MCU. I'm completely invested in universe that Feige has built even though there has definitely been some missteps. With all that being said, the MCU shows thus far have just been mediocre or generic, to put it nicely. These shows have just been terrible. The writing has easily been the biggest flaw. For the longest time, I've been able to overlook the more mediocre movies in the MCU because at the very least they're pushing the story of the universe forward, but the TV shows are much worse than almost any of the movies to release. Not only are the TV shows much more poorly made, but they're also more of a time commitment. Not only are they more of a time commitment, but it also seems that they're not going to be necessary viewing in order to keep up with movies. It's still early but if the poor quality continues, I can see many other people just unwilling to put the time into these shows. The proximate cause for this post is definitely the horrific last episode of Falcon and The Winter Soldier. It's genuinely one of the shittiest episodes of TV I've seen in a long time. The only reason why I'm going to continue to watch is because I'm invested in the MCU, but there's no way I'm going to spend my time watching these shows if they can continue in this trajectory. 

Couple of questions to everyone. What are your opinions on the Disney+ Marvel shows so far? Have you even watched them? You think they're going to last if they remain at this quality level?",movies,1617322028,ReelTalk23,True,1,13,2021-04-01

The Dark Knight really works well as its own film,"Despite technically being a sequel, it feels like its own stand alone film that you can watch without the need to really watch the predecessor before it. Also when you look at it as a trilogy, it feels the least connected to both the first and the third. Both movies focus on the League of Shadows, while this movie divided itself away from that.

What are your top 5 Martin Scorsese movies and why?,"Martin Scorsese, to me, is the greatest director of all time. Some director's might be more versatile then Scorsese, but no director has made more movies that I consider to be near masterpieces. This becomes very apparent whenever I rank his movies. Almost every movie in my top 5 ranking of Scorsese's discography has been at the 1 spot before. That is just something I can't say for almost any director other than maybe David Fincher. What do you think of my top 5 rankings of Martin Scorsese's discography? What's your top 5 Martin Scorsese movies?

1. Taxi Driver - Top 5 movie I've ever seen. Best cinematography of any Scorsese movie. Robert De Niro arguably at his best. 

2. The Departed - Probably the best ensemble cast in any Scorsese movie. Pacing, conclusion, and the heavy reliance on plot (unlike most Scorsese movies) make for such an entertaining movie from beginning to end. 

3. GoodFellas - Don't have to say much about this one. Most of you are probably going to say it's Scorseses' best, and it's difficult to argue. It almost seems like this is the movie where Scorsese mastered all of his techniques that he'd been working on for over a decade (think fast dolly zoom-in, etc.) Just having complete control over a movie knowing exactly what he wants to create. For me, the movie falls off a little bit in the third act, so I don't have it at number one.

4. The Wolf of Wall Street - Best performance in Leonardo DiCaprio's career which is saying something. I don't think Scorsese has ever been able to capture the excitement that comes with a criminal lifestyle than he did in this movie. It's 3 hours and it doesn't feel like it. Once again, kind of falls off in the third act, so I'm not going to rank it higher. 

5. Casino - Joe Pesci, great as usual. Robert De Niro, great as usual. Sharon Stone, steals the movie from all of the legends in the movie with her performance. 


That's my top 5 and I haven't even mentioned other great movies Scorsese made like The King of Comedy, The Irishman, and Raging Bull.",movies,1617323075,ReelTalk23,True,1,64,2021-04-01

Somewhere in Time (1980) is so much better than it deserves to be,"Somewhere in Time, starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour, is a movie I love, even though so much of it is ludicrous, in my opinion.

For those who haven't seen it: Christopher Reece plays  a playwright who falls completely in love with a character played by Jane Seymour, who he finds out was an actress who had performed at the hotel he is staying at in 1912. (The movie is set in 1980.) He discovers, and falls in love, with her by seeing a picture of her, which he spends quite a bit of time obsessing over. He decides he has to travel back in time to meet her and does so by hypnotizing himself to believe that he really is in 1912, and therefore he does travel back to 1912 to see her.

I'm simplified this a little, but the essentials are accurate. I'll also avoid discussing the ending to avoid spoiling it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.

So why do I think this movie, based on so ludicrous a premise, completely works?

1) Jane Seymour is genuinely beautiful enough to believe that someone could fall in love/become obsessed with her just by seeing her picture.

2) The music score is incredible. It's by John Barry and is just incredible. I'm not the sort of person who generally listens to soundtracks, but this one I listen to all the time. The music is just so moving, even out of the context of the movie.

Without the music and the good acting by the cast, I don't see this movie working at all. But it's one of favorites.",movies,1617323832,paulcosmith,True,1,10,2021-04-01

Like Don't Panic in Garden State, the opening scene or motorcycle scene in The Kids are Alright, The Sound of Silence in The Graduate, Angeles in the Royal Tenenbaums, Perfect Day in Trainspotting. Anyone else notice scenes like these are rarer in new movies? Maybe it's outdated or not serious enough to use music like this anymore?

[SPOILERS] Godzilla Vs. Kong is a way better film if you view it as a sequel to Pacific Rim.,"I feel like maybe that's even the intention? There's so many similarities such as using Ghidora's mind to 'drift' with a mech. The rift from PR could have even been a result of those weird blade runner flying cars breaking the barrier to Hollow Earth. 

I just... I cannot see this movie as a sequel to Godzilla 2014 and Kong: Skull Island when it goes so ridiculously over the top with the tech and the monster lore. However, if we view Skull Island as the first in the series, canonically, and Pacific Rim as the end point then it's a much more believable development into the high tech world of PR (especially given the opening monologue of PR saying how quickly they had to adapt)

I know the lore of PR doesn't exactly match up to what we've seen in these movies, we could put it down to years and years of Kaiju attacks hindering humanity from keeping up with historic events (such as the first official Kaiju attack)

Prove me wrong.

The spectacle, underlying social context, the scope and intimacy of the destruction and the ever-present feeling of dread make it the best monster movie in cinema history.

No other movie in this broad genre has been able to effectively communicate all of these elements. Gojira is often dismissed as just a kids movie, but it is actually a thought-provoking statement on mankind itself.

I'd like to give a shout-out to Sam Jones,"He does this series called ""The Off Camera Show"" where he likes to interview A-list celebrities and, and talk with them about who they are as people, and go deeper than who they are as famous celebrities. 

He talks with these famous actors, actresses, what have you and he is a GREAT interviewer! He allows them to feel totally safe and comfortable, and allows them to pretty much be themselves. He does ask them about their BTS experiences with projects they are part of, but he balances all of that with more serious or personal questions, all questions that are actually good. 

Part of why I wanted to say a few things about this, is because I have seen godawful interviews, one in particular is Krishnan Guru-Murphy, one of the absolute worst interviewers I have ever fucking seen. Every single guest from what I've seen, he has pissed off, maybe save for Samuel L. Jackson, but iirc his questions were still dumb. 

Sam Jones digs deep, but he actually nails it. 

This sub may not be the right place to post this, but I have no idea where else to post this, please bare with me here, especially because this is my second take on this post.

What are some great action movies that has come out in the 2010s?,"Me and my brother love action movies, I just generally love movies but he purely loves action movies cus he has this whole home theatre setup and wants them to play a lot of explosions, a lot of gunshots, and little talk in between. As in he don't like if a movie is too slow. Like Django Unchained was a bit too slow for him apparently, I know, it's insane. He sees the talking as disturbance from the action, so quality of the story don't really matter for him, but since I'm watching with him, please make your recommendations bearable in terms of story. I wanna try and watch some movies with him but it's seems troublesome as he only wants action movies and the good sounding ones at that. What are your recommendations?

He has seen:

-Most of Tarantino's movies apart from the last one. 

- Most of Nolan's movies apart from The Prestige and Tenet. 

- Mad Max: Fury Road

- MI: Fallout. 

- John Wick (he did not like it)

-6 Underground

- Extraction

- Deadpool 1 and 2

Looking forward to your recommendation. 

TL;DR: Want to watch movies with my brother. He only likes action movies. Recommend some action movies after 2010 with an at least decent story.",movies,1617144026,UmeshgaarB,True,1,43,2021-03-30

Spy Kids is 20 yrs old which makes me feel old but reminds me of how much I loved it back in the day. For me one of the biggest reasons I liked it was because it seemed to appeal to the senses. Do you agree? Let's talk about it!,When I say appealing to the senses I mean in the same way Woody getting repaired by the specialist was. One of the first things to come to mind is when the parents sit down with Floop. They are at the table with all the weird food and utensils. And Floop works on that clay to shape things. There are so many scenes I think that work. When Carmen gets those food packets out at he safe house. Juni and his gum. I think there are so much more. How do you guys feel about this.

Harry Potter and the goblet of Fire question,"There is something I didn’t understand. 

The competition is very dangerous and can lead to death. This is mentioned before the even starts.

In the  second competition they have to dive for an hour and then have to rescue a friend. 
Harry gets an honorable second place because he saved someone he didn’t have to save. So not only do the competitors Risk their lifes, but they also risk the life of relatives or friends? And these people are picked at random? An that’s totally fine for them and everyone else? Also who picked these people? 

Also at the end, when Cedric dies, they make a huge deal out of it. They say something like „it draws too much attention“. But at this point nobody knew it was Voldemort. I mean sure it’s bad someone died, but why would it put the event into a bad light if that’s what’s at stake from the very beginning and everybody knows it? 

I didn’t read the book, maybe it’s better explained there?",movies,1617147611,RDeschain1,True,1,26,2021-03-30

What are your favorite podcasts about Movies? I am looking for recommendations.,"I have been wanting to expand my podcast library and already listen to two good shows. However, if you have any podcasts about movies, either reviews or technically speaking, then list the ones that you like below. Maybe a link? 

I will start it off... 

I listen to [The Vintage Video Podcast](http://www.vintagevideopodcast.com/)

*I have been obsessed with this show. It's three friends that are watching each film that had a wide US theatrical release in the 80's. They finished their first season in 2020 and watched tons of films and reviewed them. I have found myself following along and have already watched/listened to like 90 episodes/movies.*

[Forever Midnight](https://forever-midnight.squarespace.com/)

*This one is all about horror. It's three guys that run a horror store in Northern California. They watch a different horror movie with each episode and talk about the funniest stuff ever. They have an awesome intro too. I love these guys. They even have a voice mail that you can call and they might play you on their show*",movies,1617151048,SteveMcQueen36,True,1,76,2021-03-30
The Watch [2012] is a really dumb movie and I love it,"I don't know what it is about this film but it seems like every time I'm struggling to think of something to watch I end up back here and every time it manages to exceed expectations.

I've always enjoyed Ben Stiller as the ""Straight Man"" archetype in comedy and he plays this role well alongside the rather contrasting characters of Richard Ayoade, Vince Vaughn and Jonah Hill.

The story itself is essentially just another bodysnatchers spoof but the movie contains some surprisingly hilarious lines and fantastic delivery.

The supporting cast is nothing to be sniffed at either, with some gloriously poetic cursing as per usual from R. Lee Ermy, Will Forte as the inept local police and even a young Erin Moriarty who went on to be a big name in The Boys. Not to mention the literal circle-jerk cameo from The Lonely Island boys.

It's got surprising re-watch-ability value and some of the more quotable lines always pop into my head days later and get another laugh.

Don't expect complex plot lines or in-depth character development but do expect to chuckle and be pleasantly surprised when you end up full-blown belly-laughing.",movies,1617151509,Dubtrips,True,1,25,2021-03-30

50 Shades Of Dark is a modern masterpiece,"I'm serious, I really believe that 50 Darker Shades can be recognized as a cult classic of bad films, we have to give more value to bad films, there are bad films that are works of art.  50 Tons Darker is one of the artificial films with one of the most intelligent directions, it goes through suspense, a little bit through terror, tries action, and manages to make a ridiculous story be long, it is a lot like the B suspense films of years  90, it's trash, it's weird but it has a well-established look, it has ideas so stupid that they make sense to the characters.  The two actors play bad roles very well, they know how to be bad.  There's a poster of Riddick in Christian's room.  It is stupidly brilliant how they try to make a unique film with such idiocy, but it has a lot of content.

What will be the next “big” movie genre?,"It seems as if movies go through eras - from the Spaghetti Western era of the late 60s and 70s, to the Coming-Of-Age films of the 80s, to the historic epics and disaster films of the 90s - there always seems to a new movie genre taking hold of popular culture. We’re now living in the latter stages of what film history will eventually call the “Superhero Reboots Era of the early 21st Century”

At this point, vampire films have been played out, Hollywood traded epic historical melodramas for superhero epics to make big bucks at the box office, and most of comic book franchises are maturing and the best of the era in the big screen is probably behind us, especially with the rise of episodic streaming. 

So, what’s next. Extra points if you will share your prediction of the first “record breaking” film of the post-pandemic world.",movies,1617154369,BolognaAnt,True,1,213,2021-03-30

Top 10 Best Movie Trailers,"1 - Social Network (2010): The trailer that started the fashion of dark and orchestral music.  Trailer that best summarizes the film, has a very strong emotional appeal and frantic editing.

2 - Suicide Squad Comic Con Look (2016) : Suggestive and somber, it looks like a Fincher film, and accompanies a touch of horror film.

3 - The Girl With Dragon Tatoo (2011): A summary of the film, but still, accompanying the frantic montage with a very thought-provoking soundtrack, brings the real detective atmosphere.

4 - Uncut Gems (2019): Frantic music, frantic trailer, we feel the full weight of the story of a man who runs out of time.

5 - Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015): Dark and dense, it tells the story in a different way from the film but it has a great atmosphere.

6 - Logan Teaser Trailer (2017): Sad, depressed, apocalyptic.

7 - Batman Vs Superman Teaser Trailer (2016): Dense, calm and very threatening.

8 - Avengers: Endgame Teaser Trailer (2019): It brings all the goodbye atmosphere, apart from the depressive and pessimistic tone. I still shiver with the first few seconds of the trailer, that song coming and Tony's hand.

9 - The Batman (2021): Something in the way, hmmmmm.

10 - Rocketman Teaser Trailer (2019): It's a trailer that shows a movie about a chaotic person, took great scenes and edited at a great pace.",movies,1617154993,JayDinnerClub,True,1,20,2021-03-30

"Passengers (2016) is one of the most fanfic-y, wish-fulfillment fantasy movies I've seen","It hits so many fanfic tropes in such a blatantly obvious and clumsy way it would get laughed out of Wattpad and Ao3.

Basically, I imagine the thought process of the so-called screenwriter went like this: Man, I wanna bang Jennifer Lawrence so bad. But I obviously must be the last man on Earth for that to happen. So...a post-apocalyptic scenario? Nah, too dire. Castaways on a deserted island? No, too much effort, I don't want to care about survival and shit. How about a big ass spaceship where everything is automated and I get to enjoy luxuries like robot bartenders, Mexican restaurants and bowling? Not too much luxuries, though, I only get the standard breakfast options because I gotta remain relatable to the audience as a blue-collar average joe. Not to worry, I'd get to enjoy the luxurious deluxe meal options thanks to J-Law, because her character is allowed to be of a higher social and economical status. 

Anyway, speaking of J-Law, of course I wake her up from stasis in what amounts to a decades-long attempted murder, but as it's often the case with the worst fanfics (50 Shades of Grey, etc), my sociopathic and creepy behavior will be framed as romantic or justifiable. Oh, sure, they'll be a weak attempt to condemn my actions as reprehensible, but J-Law will forgive me eventually. 

For that purpose, Laurence Fishburne will have a brief role as a Wise Old Man who randomly wakes up from stasis just to tell J-Law that she and I belong together, even though he knows nothing about us except that I deliberately and selfishly woke her up from stasis and in doing so I basically killed her, but what's a fanfic without an in-universe shipper? Anyway, Laurence Fishburne basically dies seconds after telling J-Law to give me a chance. That's necessary to maintain the Last Man Alive fantasy (God forbids J-Law falls for Laurence or something). If that weren't enough to redeem my sociopathic ass, there should be an unexpected ship-wide malfunction that I only I can fix, risking my life in the process. See, it's of the utmost importance that I am THE hero, so J-Law falls in love with me again. 

And she must fall in love so idiotically and nonsensically that she would not only abandon her dream of being the first journalist to set foot in Earth's intergalactic colony (which the movie will, without a hint of irony, frame as a selfish dream anyway because women with jobs is such a joke, amirite?), but also she would reject using the last remaining functional stasis chamber and choose getting old and dying with no one else but me instead.

I watched I saw the devil and here is my thoughts.,"I watched the highly anticipating movie för me, I saw the devil. And i feel that it has great suspects and some lesser good. One aspect i really liked was when you got to follow Chiefs police men, and jow they search for the killer. And the acting in the movie was super. The cinematogrophy spot on 5 out of 5. I also feelt the characters were developed pretty well.
But the things i thought was a little meh was, for example how did the killer survive everything? I mean  how is not braindamaged by all the hits in his head. I also didnt understand why they from nowhere throwed in a cannibal in the story. I dont hate this movie i think its ok, but i want to love, and i will probably rewatch it with a refreshed mind and see how i feel. But for now it lays on a ok 3,5 out of 5. But guys if you can, maby you can answer some of the things i didnt like with the movie. Thanks👍",movies,1616972394,Luckyseven1975,True,0,2,2021-03-28

"""Promising Young Woman"" is kind of vague.","Due to Cassie's somewhat desperate attempts to protect herself from Alexander's hands in the scene of the killing, it is uncertain whether the whole endeavor of going to the bachelor party was intended as the main plan and a factual suicide for the sake of justice or was the backup plan, with the main one being to cripple Al and throw him to the prison using the received proof of video.

She definitely considered being killed and there is no doupt on that, but was it thought to be the marginal way to go in the in case of a complete dead-end or not?

My theory is that there is something strange in the way she tightened up the second handcuff on Al, with the latter even mentioning that. 

In case it was done on purpose, for Al being able to escape, then it obviously was a conscious suicide, which makes the culmination shine even more.",movies,1616972868,DavyFry,True,2,7,2021-03-28

Some may say that John Wick  and Death Wish could fit the bill, but it never has that love/emotional element I'm looking for, just straight violence.

No movie has ever made me feel the way The Prince of Egypt does,"The soundtrack, illustrations, storyline, this movie is phenomenal. I watched the Ten Commandments recently, it was good but it doesn't seem to portray the depth of what Moses felt when he discovers that he would have been born a slave if it wasn't for his mother's quick thinking. Imaging being the imposter of your own family and watching the people around you, that would have been your family, suffer. Its like looking in a mirror and seeing a different version of yourself

It was my favourite movie as a kid but every time I watch it I love it even more. One line that gets to me every time is when Moses discovers that the Pharaoh had the firstborn sons of every family sacrificed, and the Pharaoh walks in and says ""Sometimes for the greater good, sacrifices must be made... Oh my son, they were only slaves.""

ONLY SLAVES.  The perfect way they could have framed that turning point.

The Clown Doll (2019) written and directed by Scott Jeffery. Anybody seen it?!?!,"We somewhat knew what we were getting in to when we read the short description before purchasing the movie. Basically my first thought was that I would never buy a fricken clown doll. The movie ended up being quite a bit too slow during the suspense scenes. It is one thing to be a little slower for the suspense but this took it too far and it was dragged out each “thrilling” scene. Im still debating whether this was worth the 11 dollars spent at Walmart but I guess I got quite a laugh out of certain parts. I’m not sure if they were trying to make it ridiculous and unrealistic or if it was just the lower budget. 
I would go into it more but of course don’t want to spoil it lol 

Well anyways I just wanted to post this to ask if anybody else has seen it and how’d you feel about it?? Isn’t much about the movie online so this is the only place I could think to come to even talk about it!

Actors who had no chemistry with each other,"Are there any actors whose chemistry with each other was so bad it stands out?

Chevy Chase and Carrie Fisher played love interests in Under the Rainbow, a movie that came out in 1981, when they were both at the top of their careers. You'd think they'd have fun comedic chemistry. Honestly, though, they were just really awkward with each other:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmuvlYyZgWk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmuvlYyZgWk)

It doesn't help that, even by Chase's standards, he's giving an emotionless performance here.

Was Raya and the Last Dragon wasted potential?," have to vent a little, and I'd like to know how others felt on this.

This is the first time in a while I've seen a movie and had such a strong reaction to not enjoying it very much, because this was not a bad movie. Or rather, it had an insane amount of potential. I will stress that this movie is absolutely gorgeous, Disney animation has never looked this good before. Add to that that they've a great setting with fantastic world building very reminiscent of Avatar the Last Airbender

However, as my SO and I watched it, we kept getting more and more annoyed by how we felt like they absolutely wasted it. They had everything right there. Had they omitted some of the more uncomfortable Sisu humor and the constant need for dialog anchored in modern culture (like the group project quip) and maybe fleshed out the characters, I feel like this had the potential to be an absolutely AMAZING movie.

As far as world building goes, this movie had more going for it than some of its predecessors did, e.g. Tangled and Frozen. But then they rather strangely centered the movie on a really mixed tone between some overly silly gags next to what's actually a pretty good, serious story if they'd played it more straight. It felt like Sisu undermined that at every turn

Plus, remove Sisu from the story, and what changes? Sisu wasn't necessary for gathering the gem shards, nor was she needed at the end to 'activate them' and fixing everything. I feel like there really was no need for the character at all, and movie might've been better by either omitting Sisu entirely, or have Sisu be a mute character sidekick (and perhaps redesigned to go along with a more serious tone, less My Little Pony-esque, but that may be a bad idea for toy sales). The focus could've then shifted to Raya's story arc, or Namaari's redemption arc

As for the rest of the characters, they were either (in my personal opinion) a bad idea to begin with, or given absolutely no space within the story to have personalities. My SO turned to me and said, ""I can't even tell what the Spine guy's (Tong's) personality is supposed to be"", and I realized I felt kind of the same. He was the last of his tribe, that's a really good character basis, they could've done something with that. Instead, immediately after introducing him he was part of the gang and never given any more spotlight for the rest of the movie. Hell, the entirety of Raya's crew were discovered and then immediately joined her for vague reasons, or seemingly none at all

Watching the movie just left me frustrated. I've watched many bad movies that could simply be written off as bad. But this one has so, so much potential, and I actually wanted to see more of this world and of these characters. The world is absolutely beautiful, the animation is great, the soundtrack is solid, Raya has a fantastic character design (which seems so strange juxtaposed with Sisu's absurdly cartoonish design next to her), there are so many good things about this movie that seem so wasted on a not-that-good overall product

I've watched every Disney animated movie, but this was the first one that completely let me down and left me frustrated. I did not enjoy this movie, but I loved the setting enough to want a TV show. And those are some strange mixed feelings",movies,1616980016,HannaBeNoPalindrome,True,1,5,2021-03-28

The movie Titanic makes me feel like no other movie has ever made me feel. I love it! Is there a movie that you're just completely in love with because it makes you feel something different?,"I quite literally love the movie more than any other movie. I know it's corny, but it's true. I've loved this movie every since I can remember. The actors, the music, the cultural importance, some of the historical quotes. I remember when it first came out on VHS and my parents watched the movie. I sat by them, and I don't remember anything about the movie other than lights flickering and water in the hallways. I remember loving it by the time I was like 6 though. I have watched this movie like 50 times. The last time I watched it with anyone, it was with my dad. My mom was in the kitchen, so she could hear us if we talked. It was the scene where they do the distress call, and I quoted part of it, ""CQD. The distress call."" My dad laughed at me, and my mom was like wtf, you've seen this movie THAT much? 

If the movie had a different soundtrack it wouldn't have been such a hit with me. Music is extremely important, I play instruments, I love instrumentals. The soundtrack and the movie are just so great together. The music brings me such emotion. 

I haven't told anyone about my love for the movie, but now I kind of want to. Lol. I watched it again last night, and I just love it.

Is there a movie that you're just completely in love with because it makes you feel something different? if yes, what is it, and what does it make you feel?",movies,1616874587,TreeFrogsAreLife,True,1,39,2021-03-27

2. Moonlight

Anyone else think John Powell is the master of film scores?,"I fail to \*not\* be impressed by his work. He's done stuff like How to Train Your Dragon, The Bourne Series, Solo, Kung To Panda, Shrek, X Men and so on. Every track is incredible. I love how his music sets the tone and works well with a story. It's not just generic stuff you hear in every thing. He's just the best.

 The only rivals are Alan Silvestri and Michael Giaccino. Maybe Danny Elfman. 

Everyone knows the HTTYD scores are great but I personally favour the soundtracks of X-Men The Last Stand and The Call of the Wild which may be overlooked because those movies didn't get amazing reviews even though I liked them both. Check em out, links below to my favourite tracks.

Obviously mainstays like Marvel, DC, Star Wars, and Fast and Furious aren’t going anywhere, but what do we think will be the big movie series of this decade? I’m especially talking about properties that didn’t exist (at least as franchises) in the 2010’s.
I’d say A Quiet Place is a good bet, and even though it doesn’t have the luster it once did, you can’t rule out Avatar. The one I’m really rooting for is Dune.

Russell Crowe, Alan Tudyk, Ben Foster, Peter Fonda, Christian Bale, hell even the teen actor; everyone is selling it. And the set design sells it, too. You really believe the world and the characters living in it.

The shots are beautiful. I don't really have a film vocabulary to describe it with, but there's probably a frame of every shot that I would like to blow up and hang on my wall.

"With Daniel Craig done as Bond, it would be cool to see Pierce Brosnan return for a one-off film as an older 007.","A bit of a shake up for the series. Tarantino said before that he wanted to do Casino Royale with Pierce Brosnan and set it in the '60s. Would be nice for Brosnan's Bond to go off on a high note as opposed to his final outing in Die Another Day. Could even set it in the '60s for a Connery era feel, and focus on more espionage than the visceral action that Craig's films have made much use of. 

I liked Brosnan as Bond and it seems like the consensus on Reddit, looking at previous posts, is that Brosnan was a great Bond whose films declined in quality as they went on. Craig's films have had great highs, and a couple of lows, and I'm excited to see No Time To Die, but it's sad that Brosnan went out on the lowest of points for his run. 

As a one-off experiment for the Bond series, this return could be a bit of fun.",movies,1615936333,TedRedWest,True,1,3,2021-03-16

Films stuck in development hell you think they should pull the plug on,"Friday 4-Friday After Next may not have been the greatest way to go out but let's face facts; the majority of the cast is in their late 40's-late 50's, a large percentage of the cast is dead, Chris Tucker isn't interested in coming back, and Warner Brothers isn't interested in making the movie.

Plus what would these characters even be like as middle aged men? Hell as sad as Tommy 'Tiny' Lister's passing was, I can't imagine Deebo as a sixtysomething (not Lister himself but the character) to save my life. Am I really supposed to believe someone would in their early 60's would still be stealing bikes, chains, and stuff? Or would he just bully the hood in more subtle ways like have his, say, nephew steal for him or something?

Also Austin Powers 4. Again was Goldmember the best way to go out on? Maybe not but it felt like a finale anyway, what with it literally ending with Scott turning evil and Dr. EVIL turning GOOD. Where do we really go from there, even in a franchise with loose continuity like Austin Powers? I think Dr. Evil occasionally popping up on skit and talk shows is a fine way to continue the franchise. Maybe do the same with Austin, just don't put him on fucking Uber ads, the Wayne's World ads got extremely old extremely fast (and they weren't even that good to begin with).",movies,1615939742,mranimal2,True,1,48,2021-03-16

Other examples could include All the President’s Men, Spotlight...what else? There are plenty of others, but I’m drawing a blank.",movies,1615939852,Sleepy_Chaos,True,1,146,2021-03-16
Why are people so kind towards About Time?,"I understand the sentimentality of the movie is the point, not necessarily the ins and outs of time travel, but it comes across as such a lazy film. The big emotional crux towards the end is completely ruined - they build up this whole thing about how Tim can't go back and see his father again once his new baby is born, despite showing previously that it's somehow possible to cancel out this ""don't go back to before your baby was born"" rule (he loses Posey, gets told about the rule and then manages to get her back just by going back again), and then they both go back to before all three of his kids were born anyway. 

And the defence always seems to be ""well time travel rarely makes sense"", but this is the simplest concept of time travel imaginable and it would've been so simple to make it work, but they just seemed to not care enough to make a couple of very minor changes in order to make it work. 

Also - Tim never faces any consequences for anything he's done, really. He super manipulates a woman he's just met into spending her whole life with him without ever questioning if he's done the right thing.

Skip a few years, they have some issues but still love each other. It  keeps skipping years and each time skip their marriage gets worse. We reach the their divorce they both hate each other now. At this point we starting moving back wards in time and view every thing from the Wife's perspective. Until it ends with the same scene that stars the movie. Where they are both happy.

The Princess Bride might be the most tightly edited movie I’ve ever seen,"Seriously. Most movies are chocolate chip cookies; the necessary parts are chips, the good parts are dough. The great movies are mostly chocolate chips, and dough to keep them together.

“Princess Bride” is a bowl full of chocolate chips. No scene is wasted; no FRAME is excessive. It moves so quickly. If they wanted to build out the mythology, it’s on “Lord of the Rings” levels. But it’s the nostalgic memories of a sick kid; it’s all the most action packed parts of LOTR. 

It cuts decisively through everything other than the best parts of every adventure movie. It’s edited down to the chocolate chips of every great cookie.

It’s exactly what it sets out to be. It’s dern near perfect.",movies,1615945338,probablynotthatsmart,True,1,126,2021-03-16
James Horner's score of Willow is outright magical from start to finish.,"Just some James Horner appreciation. I feel like when I talk to people about this movie they never mention the score. Obviously his work is vast and he was arguably one of the best to ever do it. I'm sure when you think of his name most would be quick to mention some of his other movies first, but there's just something about the score of Willow that will always hold a special place in my heart. The magical feeling it gave me when I first heard it and the feelings it still gives me to this day when I rewatch the movie hasn't faded one bit. Also, if you haven't seen the movie go watch it of course, its good fun from start to finish.",movies,1615945423,Writingsonthestall,True,1,20,2021-03-16

Often great books are made into mediocre movies. What are some examples of films that might arguably be as good or better than their written counterparts?,"It’s fairly easy to list the movies that fall short of the books their based off of - Ender’s Game, Watchmen (film not series - series was dope), The Hobbit trilogy.

It’s a little tougher to name the movies that meet or exceed the expectations set by the books - The Lord of the Rings trilogy, Jurassic Park are the first that come to my mind.

Are their any movies your surprised didn't get an NC-17 rating?,"After just getting through the mess that is The United States Vs. Billie Holiday, one of my main takeaways outside of how god terrible the editing was, is how extremely graphic the sex scenes are for a mainstream modern movie like this.  So much so that I'm surprised it didn't get an NC-17.     Not that i didn't have a problem with it, but I from my understanding   sex scenes in the film  broke some of the rules that the MPAA has for sex.  for example it showed showing nonmissionary sex,  as well as showing fall on of genitalia witch often gets you an NC-17, as well as the sex being  very deep passionate sex almost soft core porn like.  Why it shocked me is   Because  Team America World Police got a NC-17 rating for alot the same things in this film, yet  this one didn't and team America was using puppets!. Plus add on top of the cursing, and the blood, it seems like the MPAA would have given this. a Nc-17.

This makes me wonder are there any R rated movie, that your shocked didn't get an Nc-17 or Pg-13 didn't get R?",movies,1615945814,doowopcartoons,True,1,56,2021-03-16

Unhinged,"Hi Everyone,


This review contains spoilers....


I just finished watching Unhinged on Netflix.  It stars Russell Crowe (super fat) and a chick named Carin Pistorius.  

Anyhoo, Russell Crowe is having a bad day.  He's already killed his ex-wife, her lover and burned down their house and it's not even 9am.  Then this Karen named Carin cuts him off in traffic and he goes full psycho on her.... It's awesome!  He kills or hurts everyone around her and although he dies in the end he does so only after tearing so much from her.

It is an uplifting and inspiring movie that is good for people of all ages and ethnic backgrounds.

"How exactly does a 1.33:1 ratio ""show more of the image"" than a 1.85:1 ratio?","With ZSJL coming up I've seen a lot of people discussing the aspect ratio.

Whilst I understand the concept of filming in an IMAX ratio then cutting off the top and bottom of the screen for standard viewing, why can't they just film ""wider""?

[Here are a few screenshots from the latest ZSJL trailer](https://imgur.com/a/dizFxbQ). Surely the image would look better if there was more footage on the sides? Zeus' hands aren't even in-frame with the ""extra IMAX image"". Aquaman's staff is cut off. I found a lot of shots in the trailer to be kind of claustrophobic. I'm not here to talk shit about aspect ratios or creative choices, I'm just here to learn.

I understand filming something for widescreen, and then the top and bottom in IMAX is bonus image. However, a lot of these shots genuinely feel like the sides are cut. In these scenarios, why wouldn't a widescreen ratio ""show more of the image""?",movies,1615763819,NathanTheSamosa,True,1,3,2021-03-14

First time watching Tron and Tron : Legacy back to back,"As the titles says, for the first time ever, I watched both Tron and Tron legacy, back to back.

Tron, although very much showing it's age, was very enjoyable. Sure the whole movie almost feel in a rush to tell it's story and isn't very innovative, but it's visuals were very unique and you felt an attention to detail when crafting this virtual world.

Tron : Legacy, on the other end, got the advantages but also the pitfalls of today cinema : it was visually stunning and arguably entertaining ad an action packed movie, but in the end was extremely generic. The scene that completely took me out of the movie was when CLU goes to adress his army of repurposed programs. When the army goes ""ahou ahou"" to hail CLU before his ""grand speach"" it felt so much like that came from a board meeting where exec just went ""every well recieved movie with an army does it, so we must do it"".

And it made me realise the movie is filled to the brim with that : the ""evil exec board"" of Ecom with no bearing on the story, the pointless over exited crowd of programs at the death games, the whole ""nightclub"" sequence. Those scenes were all out of place in the movie, with no logical reason why programs, radically different life forms that don't think the same way we do, would do that. It would be one things if ISOs were shown very close to human, but every single program was. You don't even know what their in-movie function is. Maybe to boost CLU's ego inherited from Flynn, I don't know.

Watching both those movies one after the other and for the first really shows how shallow the production and narrative design has become when studios attemp cash-ins on properties with distinct feels,  style and stories.",movies,1615765658,Sam_Hunter01,True,1,4,2021-03-14

Another prevalent theme throughout the documentary is how inspired and influenced he was/is by Alfred Hitchcock.

Speed is excellent,"I just watched this movie and it was damn good! Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock were both superb, along with everyone else involved. Nobody sucked in this at all. This is an action film but most of it just involved the bus, but man did they get it right with the action just involving a bus!

It was also super smart and clever. That &gt;!baby scene, totally had me fooled.... Annie drove into it, and that stroller went flying, but it was revealed to be full of cans..... I thought I was about to see a baby die! I loved that part!&lt;! Jack was also a badass in this. He was going to stop at nothing to make sure those passengers got to see another day, &gt;!even though he couldn't save everyone!&lt;. He had imperfections, because he was also just a person. He was super smart, but took awhile awhile to catch on to some things, like the &gt;!camera part, took awhile to figure out that they were being recorded right inside the bus!&lt;. There is also when he instructed the passengers to go on the one side so that there could be better balance when turning a sharp right in a small area, I do not think I could have thought of that during such a stressful situation. 

I also like the part where Ortiz tried to help Jack when that idiot pulled a gun him, and he tried to disharm him. I like that some of the passengers weren't completely useless. Jack is just a human who couldn't do every little thing himself.

Disney princesses don't always need to be saving the world,"I recently rewatched *Tangled* and was surprised by how *low* the stakes seemed - there was no apocalyptic plot, no skybeams, the kingdom was not in any danger and the plot was free to revolve around Rapunzel's coming-of-age arc and her struggle to break free of her narcissistic mother.

*Frozen* was not vastly different - the plot still centered the sisters' relationship and Anna's triangle with Hans &amp; Kristoff, but it added to the urgency by introducing the subplot of having to save Arendelle. That subplot is not strictly necessary - you could remove it and have Anna go looking for Elza for her own personal reasons, but it does make for some nice setpieces. 

*Moana* and *Raya*, however, did away with character drama altogether - the princesses are now solitary characters who go on a Hero's Journey to save the Land from a Faceless Evil. They don't have friends, but rather journey companions, and they don't have a lot of personal conflicts an average viewer would empathize with.

I enjoy the newer movies for what they are - there's absolutely gorgeous - but I do wish Disney allowed the characters to deal with some personal shit without having to worry about stopping an evil cloud for a gazillionth time.",movies,1615768791,alexshatberg,True,1,33,2021-03-14

[Spoilers] Can someone explain the older guy who ran the cult / community for deaf people in The Sound of Metal (2019) ?,"**SPOILERS AHEAD**

I've just finished watching The Sound of Metal and I was not happy with it. I don't know about you all, but I do not enjoy watching a guy lose everything in life on screen. It reminds you that anyone can wake up being deaf or blind one day and that we should take things for granted. The movie was also pretty boring. I'm a huge metalhead and so I thought it would be more about the music.


The one part I did not understand in the movie was the cult / community for deaf people. I usually go into movies blind (meaning I never watch trailers, read reviews/comments about a movie, and just go in literally only knowing the Rotten Tomatoes score), so when I started getting cult vibes when he went to the deaf community and the dude asked for his keys and phones, I thought this would be a horror movie about a cult (it was not unfortunately), lol.


I didn't understand the main deaf guy, the Vietnam veteran who ran the cult / community. Why was he so against getting implants or having his fellow deaf people believe that they don't have a disability that can be treated ? He was against all medical treatment for hearing loss, but I just did not understand why. Can someone explain that to me ? Why did the community resemble a cult and cut people off from phones for example ? What was the point of that ?",movies,1615770891,thesquarerootof_1,True,1,7,2021-03-14

What was with the reluctance in sitting Godzilla in the '14 and '19 movies compared to Kong in Skull Island?,"I watched them all back to back to get ready for the new one and it's just something I noticed. Obviously not the first person, but I've never read about any of them so I don't know

But in the Godzilla movies as soon as the action starts, it seems to immediately cut away so you can see what the humans are doing. Even just shots of seeing Godzilla standing, it's like you're only allowed to see him for a few seconds then it's back to the humans

Then in Skull Island, you see Kong in all his glory inside the first 20 minutes. Not even glimpses, you see him full on wracking shit. It's so good

Even when he's fighting monsters, it doesn't cut away for a few minutes to see what the humans are doing. You see the full fights and you'll see what they're doing because they're in the background

"""Welcome to Chechnya"" is an incredible and horrifying documentary. For the love of God don't ignore this movie.","Just finished it and I'm kind of in awe. It follows the efforts of LGBT activists in Russia as they move Chechen refugees out of the country. It's far from an easy, feel-good watch but I haven't seen a documentary move me on an issue like this in a very long time.

You might have heard about the VFX twist of the film: it utilizes deep fake technology to hide the identities of activists, refugees, and their families without the need to blur their faces. It's weirdly seamless and helps along a desperately human story. It's on the shortlist for the visual effects Oscar... don't be surprised if it winds up with a nomination.

I went straight to the subreddit and was disappointed to see it didn't have a discussion thread or a ton of buzz, so I thought I'd throw it out there. It's a great film and if you have HBO, you should really give it a try.

What exactly is the REAL symbolism in King Kong?,"I finally watched King Kong (2005). During the movie, I thought it was a commentary about animal abuse. Taken from their natural habitat and exploited for our own benefit, in an environment unfamiliar to them. But after going online a bit, I thought that maybe back then it was a critique of how white men treated black men. I still think it makes sense: King Kong NEVER hurts Ann. Not once. And yet the population still is hurtful towards him. He saves Ann multiple times, yet he's treated as a beast. He's also taken as a slave. 

When you think about it, the way white men treated black people back then is not so different from the way they treated animals. So I think maybe the movie was trying to have a commentary on both issues?

But that kind of wouldn't make sense because it wasn't the airplanes, it was beauty killed the beast.

I wonder what was the real meaning of that line. Some say it shows Kong died because in his mind, he was shielding her from danger. He goes out of his way multiple times just to save her. Of course, he doesn't realize if he left her on the ground she would never have been in danger in the first place. 

Some say it symbolizes how humans can be blinded by love. How they pursue women and it can lead to their demise. 

My very first interpretation of that line immediately after I heard it was that King Kong had ""died"" once he fell in love with Ann. It killed the beast within him. He had become human yet they killed him. Now I realize that was probably VERY wrong. 

What exactly do YOU think is the right meaning of the entire movie? I think all of those theories make sense in a way but I think my favorite would probably be the animal abuse and racism. The final line complements it more than I initially thought. The final line is an acknowledgment from Carl that Kong truly did love Ann and he tried to protect her. It's his acknowledgment that he didn't kill a beast, he killed a living creature who had feelings.

Scarface is a much better movie than the Godfather,"Scarface shows the depth of human psychology very well  


1. Tony helps a mafiozo, gaining wealth and respect, only to kill said mafiozo  
 and take his woman
2. Tony shows affection to Elvira, only to ridicule and insult her once she's actually with him
3. Tony kills his friend and many other people, but killing 2 kids is too much for him 
4. Tony shows affection to his sister, taking care of her, only to end up destroying her happiness 
5. The way Tony dies perfectly metaphorises tge way he's lifed his life 
6. Despite all that the viewer cheers for him   
 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Godfather is extremely boring. The story is exceptionally uneventful. During the movie, i would often wonder ""wait, am i supposed to recognize this guy?"". The movie throws an aburd amount of characters and mini plots but fails to provide a reason for them. What does Michael's expedition to Sicily in G1 provide to the story, exactly? Or the fact his first wife dies? What does it matter? Who cares! It doesn't impact the plot at all!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Scarface is superior to Godfathe

&amp;#x200B;

Scarface is everything Godfather would have liked to be  


Scarface = an underrated gem     Godfather = an oferrated soap opera.

)

The official podcast for *Judas and the Black Messiah* is now fully released, with hours of commentary from Chairman Fred Jr., Mama Akua Njeri, Shaka King, Ryan Coogler, and more. If you haven't seen the film yet, [give it a watch](https://www.hbomax.com/judas-and-the-black-messiah) before it leaves HBO Max in two days.

Also, I thought I'd take the opportunity to recommend some related materials so people can learn more about the subject. This is far from a comprehensive list and barely scratches the surface, but it should be a solid start. I've seen a disappointing amount of comments in other threads spreading FBI propaganda and misinformation, so hopefully these resources can help counter those narratives.

Recommended Documentaries:

* [The Murder of Fred Hampton](https://vimeo.com/434141029)
 * An essential documentary with footage of Chairman Fred Hampton in his own words. The first half focuses on his speeches and survival programs, while the second half documents the assassination and attempted cover-up by police and State's Attorney Edward Hanrahan
* [All Power to the People](https://youtu.be/pKvE6_s0jy0)
 * Details the history of the Black Panther Party and the FBI's counterintelligence program, aka COINTELPRO (in my opinion, it does a better job at showing the extent of COINTELPRO than the PBS documentary *Vanguard of the Revolution*)
* [Eyes on the Prize II](https://www.kanopy.com/product/eyes-prize)
 * The series containing William O'Neal's first and only public interview (as depicted in *Judas and the Black Messiah*). The specific episode is titled ""A Nation of Law"", and you can find his uncut interview further below

* [The FBI and the Panther](https://abc.com/shows/1969/episode-guide/season-01/04-the-fbi-and-the-panther)
 * Episode 4 of PBS' *1969* series; there's a lot of overlap with the documentaries above but I enjoyed hearing Mama Akua (formerly known as Deborah Johnson) telling the story of how she met Chairman Fred and the time they spent together

Recommended Books:

 * Safiya Bukhari provides some important commentary on Black Panther Party members locked up as political prisoners (some of them are still in prison right now, decades later)

Some fascinating information in here that you won't find anywhere else...

Full disclosure: I avoided mentioning a few books on Chairman Fred like *The Assassination of Fred Hampton*, *From the Bullet to the Ballot*, and *Black Against Empire*. I don't want to discourage people from checking those out, as there is some good information to be found in them. However, I would like to acknowledge that the filmmakers used these as sources for the initial script but later learned that the books were refuted by the Hampton family. [Shaka King has explained this in interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1395&amp;v=NaQguNyU5Xo), and it's also discussed during the first 10 minutes of Episode 2 of the Judas and the Black Messiah Podcast. It's tough finding good sources on the Black Panther Party, since [the majority of articles came from the FBI](https://youtu.be/KPN8LHVeFYA). That being said, I hope this post will at least point people in the right direction!",movies,1615591236,go4Ds,True,1,0,2021-03-12
Every time I watch I Am Legend (2007) I get really upset that they didn't use the alternate ending instead of the one they chose. (Spoilers),"I'm going to preface this by saying, yes, I've read the book, and I've just learned to separate cinema with the book at this point.

Since most things are digital nowadays, and maybe there are a lot of younger people who didn't really grow up during the whole evolution of DVDs. One of the coolest features was that A LOT of movies had alternate endings. It was one of the driving forces for people to switch over from VHS and buy super expensive DVD players; extra content. Unfortunately, I haven't really seen any streaming service offer outtakes or the alternate endings yet (or maybe they never will). I just feel like I had to explain this for a lot of people who might not be aware that this was actually one of the driving forces of actually buying the DVD. 

Anyways now that I explained that I'm old, let me just say how I Am Legend's key scenes in the movie make ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE out of context of the alternate ending. 

For anyone who hasn't seen it, the alternate ending is that Robert realizes that the ""night walker"" that he kidnapped actually was the....let's say mate of the night walker that seems to be the main antagonist throughout the movie. He ends up releasing her to him and essentially they just sort of fuck off and they escape.

Sounds a bit cheesy right?

However, in that context we see the driving force of things that make absolutely no sense in any other context in the original cut.

Why was the make night walker going into the sunlight, defying its survival instincts, which Robert clearly noticed? 

These are supposed to be ravenous vampire like monsters who only care about feeding on flesh, yet they copy his trap to ensnare him which shows a pretty decent amount of intelligence.

And why set a trap at all? The hundreds of night walkers are going to all feed on one corpse? It just doesn't make any sense.

And why focus specifically on one specific night walker? They make one's face super distinctive so you know it's the same exact one throughout the movie. 

Rewatching it for the first time after a decade, I practically forgot that this was the actual ending to the movie. 

I just feel like even if it was pretty corny for an ending, it was still better than what was put out, given the context of the motive of the main night walker.

Otherwise, it really just doesn't make sense to me.

How One Line In Ford vs Ferrari Makes The Real Life Outcome Seem A Million Times More Stupid Than It Should Be,"I've watched Ford vs Ferrari multiple times and I only just realized how stupid the ending actually was logically when considering how Le Mans works. Before you flame me, yes I know this is based on real events, so this is kind of knit picking the verbiage the screenwriters chose.

When Josh Lucas' Bebe brings up the ""photo"" finish, Bernthal's Iacocca brings up the fact that Bale's Miles is quote ""laps ahead"". With how Le Mans works that shouldn't have mattered. This is because Le Mans, being a 24 Hour Race, operates off of # of laps to determine the places not who crosses the track first after the 24 hours. 

Even if Miles slowed down to be a lap ahead of the next closest Ford for the photo finish he still would have won the race. Instead, he slows down so that #2 Ford ends up on the same lap and the #5 Ford is 12 laps behind for the photo finish. By that logic, even with the murkiness of Le Mans rules, Miles did not have to slow down to that big of an extent. Thus, Miles is in theory at fault for his loss because he slowed down too much and lost Le Mans.

That line by Bernthal's character is ironically dumb considering he is the one who first suggested to Henry Ford II to build cars for Le Mans. He surely would have understood the rules of Le Mans and known that being laps ahead wouldn't have mattered in terms of achieving the photo finish. Why would he not know the rules of Le Mans if he suggested they go there in the first place. What would only matter is them lining up, with either Miles speeding (which would arguably be easier) while they slow down because they safely held the 3rd car finished 9 laps ahead of 4th place or Miles slowing down enough for them to get on the same page way before the end when he would still be laps ahead.

This is how one singular sentence given enough context absolutely makes the real life ending of Ford vs. Ferrari feel like accident of stupidity",movies,1615591999,T1Facts,True,1,3,2021-03-12
Help recommend a movie based on what I like? I recently saw The Pledge,"The Pledge (2001) with Jack Nicholson seems to be a polarizing film and I was hesitant on watching it. It scoring a 52% audience score on rotten tomatoes, yet being considered a 'great' film by Roger Ebert, I was torn between what to do. I ended up watching it and it is now one of my favorite films.

&amp;#x200B;

I trust Roger Ebert's opinions for the most part, since I agree with much of his reasoning in film critique. For example; I am not a huge Tarantino fan, yet I enjoyed the hell out of Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction. I disliked Reservoir dogs in accordance to how praised it is. Roger Ebert seemed to share these same views since he gave it a 2 and a half stars as opposed to 4/4 stars for both Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been considering a few titles recently, but am always unsure. I wouldn't say I'm picky when it comes to film, but I like one that draws you in - whether or not it's considered ""slow"". Taxi Driver, The Conversation, Blade Runner and Mulholland Drive are some of my all time favorite films. It is odd though, because some films that are deemed great I found extremely boring (The Arrival, Gone Girl, Deliverance, Dark City).

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a list of some movies I am considering: Don't Look Now (1973), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (hesitant on this one since I found Contact &amp; The Arrival a snoozefest), Night Moves (1975), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (do not care for romance nor Jim Carrey though), Vertigo.

I notice Vertigo is one of those classics I never saw. I heard that it is most similar to the Hitchcock film I really enjoyed, Rear Window.

Charles Bronson 1970's Output,"Charles Bronson starred in an incredible 24 films between 1970 and 1979. If you do the math, it meant *each year* you could expect to see a whopping 2.4 new Charles Bronson films released either to the theater (which most of them were) or on TV!

While the one film most may recognize today is 1974's *Death Wish*, and there are several made during that time which which may not be worth pursuing, there are also several which *are* worth seeing, IMHO.

So if you have some free time and want to catch up on Charles Bronson's run during the 1970's, you could do worse than watch these films...

*Red Sun* (1971) Bronson stars with Ursula Andress, Alain Delon, Capuccine, and (reads notes) Toshiro Mifune?! in an oddball western involving a samurai sword.

*Chato’s Land* (1972) Bronson stars as Chato, a half-Indian who in the movie’s opening minutes is goaded by a racist Sheriff into drawing and killing the man, which sets off a long manhunt to capture him. Bronson barely speaks in what is mostly a symbolic role, but the film wonderfully presents the whole “a few rotten apples” concept regarding the posse sent after him and, despite the film’s age, can be viewed as interesting symbolism with today’s politics.

*The Mechanic* (1972) Most may remember the remake and sequel with Jason Statham. Terrible films, IMHO, compared to the original which features Bronson as a experienced hitman who takes on a hotshot newcomer, played by Jan Michael Vincent, and plenty of games are soon afoot. Features a spectacular (IMHO!) ending.

*Hard Times* (1975) Bronson and James Coburn are illegal boxer and his “promoter”. Wonderful early script/direction by the great Walter Hill (*The Warriors*, *48 Hours*, etc.).

*Breakheart Pass* (1975) a favorite of mine and based on a novel by Alistair Maclean. Bronson gets involved in a train ride with various shady characters and murder. In some respects, it plays out sorta/kinda like *Murder on the Orient Express* in the Wild West!

*The White Buffalo* (1977) Perhaps the most bizarre film on this list features Bronson as Wild Bill Hickok who meets up with Crazy Horse and they go hunting for the mythical beast. Part *Jaws* in the Wild West (!!!) part head trip, I nonetheless find the film a fascinating and unique work.

*Telefon* (1977) I conclude this list with this Don (*Dirty Harry*, the original *Invasion of the Body Snatchers*) Siegel directed film. Bronson plays a Russian agent tasked to stop a rogue Russian scientist who intends to awaken sleeper agents within our country. The sleeper agents, once awoken, will carry out murders and cause considerable destruction. A great thriller, IMHO!

 i saw this movie back in 2012 in 3D and it was so good, probably the best movie i've seen in 3D. in rewatching it, i'm still so impressed by the feel of the flying fish scene. the CGI in Life is Pi is incredible. but this is the one scene that blew me away in theatres because it was so unexpected, and it still has the same effect. it's a really short scene, maybe under a minute. but it just captured the intensity so well. and all they did was change the aspect ratio and have the fish flying in and out of the black bars- simple yet so effective use of 3D. are there other movies/scenes that employ this effect?",movies,1615421072,seethar,True,1,16,2021-03-10

I think it was a silent movie, or with very little dialogue. It was set up like a play so everything happened on a set and the same set was used throughout. I never finished it all, and it was quite a while ago so I don’t remember fully, but the basic premise was the people of the town helped a woman who was new there, and then in turn they all started having their way with her. It was shown that their mentality changed from helpful to expecting her to put out for them, at this point I got uncomfortable as it definitely wasn’t what I signed up for, hence why I never finished it.

Chloe Zhao is being held up as an indie darling breakthrough when her background is anything but.,"Something that has been bothering me as I’ve seen coverage for “Nomadland,” is how Zhao is portrayed as someone coming from obscurity to one of the most in-demand filmmakers in Hollywood. This has nothing to do with her ethnic background - please don’t take this as anti-Chinese screed. 

This does have to do with to the fact that her story is not atypical, but very privileged in a way that many so called indie filmmaker stories are.

He has a rough start I’m prison but slowly starts to make friends and even starts doing the accounting for the warden. His best friend is an older Blackman who can get people anything from outside prison (ciggs, candy, books). The two form a strong  friendship. Although the main character is doing just fine in prison he longs for freedom and slowly starts to dig a tunnel out of prison. It takes him 20 or thirty years but he makes it out and escapes to Mexico.  The black character is granted his freedom years later and the two unite in Mexico.

It's not just nostalgia, the games are just simply excellent! 

One thing's for sure, Tom Hardy is gonna have to get into shape for this. Sam Fisher is a pretty physically demanding character. He crouches A LOT, carries bodies on his back, knocks out ppl and kills them up close, climbs fences and pipes a lot, and hangs from the latter.

Superman Returns (2006) is so much better than all the superman films with Henry Cavill.,"I will never understand why Warner Bros. was so disappointed with the film. Canceling the planned sequel for 2009 was a pretty rash decision. I understand that the film only made like 200 million, but I just don't understand why they cut bait with Brandon Routh and completely rebooted the series with Henry Cavill 7 years later. Routh did a really good job I thought. And I think Cavill did has done a shit job in all the films since (the storylines have not done him any favors). 

The story for Superman Returns is 10x better than all of the recent stories combined. It was very well directed, and everything else about it (characters, acting, screenplay, cinematography, score, special effects) was top-notch. Man of Steel was mediocre at best, and the other films that have had Cavill as superman are pure trash. I just really like the simplicity of Superman Returns and I wish that the sequel would have had a chance to be made.",movies,1615244484,hominoid_in_NGC4594,True,1,37,2021-03-08

Justice League Snyder Cut,"I was going to check out Tom &amp; Jerry for some mindless background show but what looked like the Justice League movie kept playing everytime I restarted it. It was weird because it was in 4:3 aspect ratio. I'm  guessing someone messed up and accidentally linked that to Tom &amp; Jerry. Eventually after about an hour, it just cut out to an error saying restart the app and now Tom and Jerry is playing. It was pretty boring if it was the Snyder cut but I never saw the original.

Can anyone explain why the pacing of some horror in recent years feels so strange?,"A lot of times I finish a movie made  in the past 5 years and at the end it feels like nothing really happened  or we're just seeing the very beginning, and it seems worse with more  horror movies and it's something I haven't seen until recently. Random  example, I saw Open House, A Curse For Wellness, and A Nightmare Wakes  and I got this feeling.  Obviously lots of things *happen*,  but a lot of it goes by quickly and it all feels inconsequential and  random in the end. It's surreal but never for any reason and maintains a  mundane tone without any real payoff. It's kind of more of a lite drama  with a ghost thrown in or something.

It's not that I'm against slow-paced  horror (I love The Witch and Hereditary, these are examples that pull it  off very well). What I'm talking about is more like the opposite of movies made for people with very short attention span, these types of ""horror movies"" will rather focus on the process of a character unwrapping a TV dinner and  putting it into the microwave for 10 minutes.",movies,1615245232,IcyHotRoad,True,1,21,2021-03-08

What Do You Think of Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut?,"Let me first say that I labeled this NSFW for the fact that discussions about this film inevitably involve its sexual content, not violence.  Now, let's get started.

I am a huge fan of Stanley Kubrick's films and I've seen almost all of them through DVDs and television showings.  There is one, however, that eluded me for years and it was his final film Eyes Wide Shut.  This film was never to be shown in my household (let's just say my parents knew all too well about the film's story and everything ""dirty"" in it).  It was around mid November of last year when the film was set to air on TV and I looked ahead to see what it was rated.  I had already learned of the two separate versions of the film and that the R-rated version featured edits to tone down the film's infamous ""orgy scene"".  The version that was set to air was the R-rated one and I, a guy now in his twenties and of appropriate age, decided it was time to finally see the film that eluded me for so long.  

Let me just say that, even with the edits, I still didn't know what to expect.  I had seen some snippets of the film and I knew about the story, but I was basically going into it blind.  I was truly surprised when I noticed that the film's sexual content was actually quite tame, though the orgy could've been far more extreme if it weren't for the edits.  I would even dare to say that I've seen horror movies with more nudity and sex involved.  After my worries were set aside, I finished watching the film.

Eyes Wide Shut, to me, isn't up to par with some of Kubrick's other films, but I actually like it because it stands out from the others in terms of story, themes, and characters.  The film's story of Dr. Bill Hartford's quest to alleviate his jealousy over his wife's dream affair, by cheating on her, and it leading to him getting pursued by a dangerous secret society was something truly different.  I did prefer everything from the Masked Ball onward, but the early scenes also provide us with an interesting dilemma concerning jealousy, one of the film's core themes.  How would we react if we were in Bill's shoes? Would we act on impulse / jealousy (like he did) or out of rationality?

The film also deals with the theme of deception in plain sight, or metaphorical masks.  From the Masked Ball onward we see characters, both old and new, exhibit off-putting behavior in Bill's presence and it makes us question who is a friend or foe.  No one can be trusted and we, just like Bill, are in denial of the idea that a seemingly friendly character from before could turn face and do harm.  We, just like the saying that influenced the title, have our eyes wide shut to a possibly terrible truth when they should be the opposite.  It is this theme and the constantly questionable morals, or lack thereof, of the characters that make them both hard to connect with, yet intriguing in terms of the secrets they may carry.

Overall, I enjoyed Eyes Wide Shut.  Even though it does feel incomplete (especially with the ending), I feel it does have something unique to offer for an older admirer of Kubrick's films.  The well regarded cast, superb cinematography, and excellent soundtrack are just some of the many things that contribute to the film's enduring, albeit debated, legacy.

"""The Education of Frederick Fitzell""... What happened to this movie?","Just wondering if anyone else is as frustrated as I am right now wondering why there are no updates to this film's release status. I was very intrigued by the trailer and was looking forward to checking this film out. The movie has screened at some festivals and apparently for some critics and seems to have gotten decent reviews. Normally I wouldn't mind waiting so much, but I feel there's been a dearth of satisfying new films coming out that really interest me and that I can stay distracted with in the meantime.

With so many films being pushed back and having their release dates and cinema / rental / streaming status switched up so many times because of COVID, it's just infuriating when you're willing to throw cash at a studio just to have something new to watch and there are literally no updates available anywhere online.

I understand why big huge blockbusters are waiting to release their films, because they really need the cinema box office ticket sales to make back their budget. But I don't understand why smaller indie films like this seem to get stuck in limbo now, when people are stuck at home and begging for new movies to watch. I recently rented Synchronic on VOD, as some aspects of the premise were similar (a strange new drug), and it was okay, but I really want more new indie horror / thrillers and I'm willing to pay for them! I spent the money to rent Invisible Man and it was okay. I rented the new Wrong Turn against my better judgement and it was terrible. The Little Things was alright for a little killer thriller, I think expectations were just overblown based on the cast. But after all that, I'm still here with my wallet out ready to watch some new stuff.

Theaters are just now reopening in my area but there's nothing I care to see out now. Chaos Walking? Bleh... The only other things playing are cartoons and light dramas / comedies. Are any streaming services out there listening? Some company needs to buy this movie and put it out already! Or at least give an update...",movies,1615254197,happybarfday,True,1,10,2021-03-08

"[DISCUSSION] Anyone seen Centigrade (2020)? Thoughts? IMDB gave it a 4.3 score, i find it deserves higher","No discussions going on about it on Reddit, really. 

A lot of things baffled me about this movie. How could the couple just get snowed in that badly, on a road that no one ever takes or something??? Did they not watch the weather forecast before taking a long car trip in the middle of nowhere, with a woman that could go into labor quite soon? No one from their friends or family questioned their disappearance or sent out a search team? Why didn’t they decide to climb out while they still could? How did they have so many candles in a car????  The husband who kept saying “we don’t know what’s out there, we shouldn’t leave the car”. Excuse me, what. You had no idea where you were driving and how far away from the hotel you probably were? This is modern times, people have GPS, even if reception was bad, they must have had SOME clue how far away civilization would be.

Maybe the movie has a poor score because a lot of details weren’t really addressed and it was difficult to justify some of the choices the couple made. The beginning was especially frustrating and the couple was a bit insufferable, either sitting in silence or bickering. I live in a Canada so I’m familiar with winter conditions, I imagine Norway can have heavy snowfalls, but enough to bury a car overnight? You’d almost think these people just got in a car spontaneously and decided to drive God knows where (except the plot stated they were travelling to a hotel for a book signing). Where is this hotel that there is no civilization travelling on the roads around it?? Who would even go to a book signing somewhere hours away on roads that don’t even have regular snow removal. And if it’s THAT remote, why go in the middle of such extreme winter conditions. I have so many questions. 

I find this movie had a lot of potential to be a real nail biter, because if we disregard certain details, I kind of was on the edge of my seat (well, couch lol) by the end and was terrified for them. That situation was a complete nightmare. What a tragic story that could have been easily avoided.",movies,1615129179,mariapronina,True,1,3,2021-03-07

Why so much hate for Jaime Foxx?,"Jaime Foxx is one of the most talented dudes in hollywood. He can do pretty much anything and has been for almost thirty years. Drama, comedies, stand up, voiceover work, the guy can even sing. Django, Willie Beaman, Ray, collateral, Ali, miami vice, horrible bosses, Baby Driver, I mean it's ridiculous.

What movie was it that opened with an abortion clinic bombing?,"Hello all. I'm trying to find a drama from a few years ago that featured heavily around abortion. Only I forgot almost everything about it except the opening scene. In the opening scene, a woman in a red dress bombs an abortion clinic. She's a pro-life terrorist, but I think that scene is the only scene in the movie she appears in. 

Surely the movie I'm trying to find is NOT Unplanned, right?? That movie opens with an abortion happening, not a clinic bombing. 

And it's not Red Christmas either. That movie also features a clinic bombing, but the terrorist is a man.

"Coming to America 2 is a sexist, condescending sequal that should never have happened","I finally saw Coming to America 2 and it was indeed as some anticipated, an abysmal flop.

The absolutely fabulous costumes and typical black comedy jokes we now anticipate from Eddie Murphy's movies failed to conceal the fact that the entire movie is premised on Prince/King Akeem fathering a son after being drugged and raped in a one night stand. I'm not at all surprised that the Directors thought to ship this movie considering the fact that Male sexual abuse is more often than not employed as a comic relief in Hollywood.

In the contrast to Black Panther's fictional world of Wakanda, Zamunda would qualify as an ill-informed foreigner's depiction of a Kingdom in Africa, a fancy castle deep in the middle of a jungle. And let's not forget the McDowells (I think that's the name) fast food restaurant complete with roaming elephants. In light of the fact that some, if not most, Americans are completely ignorant of life outside the continent besides diagrams of countries on a map, I'd say it's about time Hollywood understands that Africa ≠ a jungle with Lions and Elephants. 

In the end, I suppose the Directors expected critical reviews of the C2A as both Lavelle and Mirembe, in the garden scene, discuss terrible sequals and remakes of movies, which I found particularly hilarious and ironic.

"Stonehearst Asylum/Eliza Graves (2014) is an amazingly overlooked thriller based on a short story by Edgar Allen Poe. The cast includes Kate Beckinsale, Jim Sturges, David Thewlis, Ben Kingsley, Brendan Gleeson, Michael Caine, Jason Flemyng...","“An Oxford graduate takes up a job in a mental asylum, only to discover that the ""revolutionary"" new treatments are inhumane, and that there is more going on than meets the eye.”

Directed by Brad Anderson, this one belongs to the better half of his repertoire. 

Sometimes it suffers a little from pacing issues, however the stellar cast, the eerie atmosphere and the story itself more than make up for it. 

If it didn’t suffer constant comparison from Shutter Island, it would maybe be more appreciated.

He’s been acting for a decade now (I first saw him in Homeland season 2) but it seems recently he’s getting his rave reviews for every performance of his. Even his kinda mediocre films like Hot Summer Nights or A Rainy Day in New York, he does well with the material. 

When CMBYN came out, it was one of the biggest critical hits of that year and now he’s getting in everything.

"I want to tell you about a very unique and magnificent film, that's all the more unique and magnificent because of how boring it sounds like it's going to be when it's described. (12 Angry Men)","No matter how I spin it, it's going to sound like it's boring as hell, and I am easily bored. I mean, how good could a film possibly be that:

  
\- Was filmed in 1957  
\- Is in black and white  
\- Is set entirely in a single room and adjoining bathroom  
\- Has almost no action or comedy or physical danger  
\- Is cast solely by middle aged white men  
\- Is based on a play  
\- And none of the characters have names

  
For a lot of people I know, any one of those traits alone would be enough to pass it over. I understand, but it breaks my heart because this movie is one of my all time favourites, and the favourite of some of my most respected friends!

  
It is called 12 Angry Men, you've never seen anything like it, and you probably never will again. I watch it every year at least and it feels like it'll remain ageless and relevant for at least another hundred years.

After the first Battles Without Honour And Humanity anything with Bunta Sugawara I wanted to see, so going into Street Mobster I was ready for the ultra violence of the Fukasaku films and also the pure badassery of Bunta, but in the end I was kind of disappointed, yes it was the first film of it's kind that Kinji made about the Yakuza but my thought prior was that because it was the first it would be the best, I did enjoy it but I want to know what everyone else thinks about it.",movies,1614902461,Karlhoey,True,0,9,2021-03-04

Grease is STILL the Word!,"So it's 2021, yet this movie is set back in the Summer of '59. No phones, no laptops/computers, nothing, just Greasers with their cheap leather jackets, and old, beat-up cars. Yet this movie is still so much cooler than anything that Hollywood could possibly produce today. Most of us can even sit through the credits, it's that good.

I reckon 99% of us here would've for that gang to be a real gang in school and just be part of it. Life was so much better back then. Eating ice cream at the parlor, going to the drive in, having fun at the disco (or as you yanks say, 'prom'), and just enjoying whatever life throws your way.

As a side note, it's interesting how such an awesome movie detailing a 10 month school year can be done in only 110 minutes. Also just a fun fact, this movie, was filmed in black and white in 1978, then digitally remastered to be in color.

Just want to finish this off by saying R.I.P. to cool guy of the gang, the original Danny in the musial, Jeff ""Kenickie' Conway.

"Okay, ""Monster Hunter"" is quite good. (Spoilers)","I didn't like any of the Resident Evil movies except the last one Paul Anderson did, and that was only till the halfway point.

I found myself very much engaged in this action, fantasy film. Milla Jovovich looks amazing as hell, and Tony Jaa is a great partner in this. The costume, set, and monster designs are very well done.

Some of the cinematography is visually stunning (the faraway shots of the desert with the military trucks destroyed and wreckage makes it more so).

It really feels like you're in another time and place. This movie deals with that, and is part of the story so that was a pleasant surprise.

The music at times sounds like something from RE.

The one thing I hated is the Ron Pearlman look alike actor with his weird hair style. Looks so fake and just bad. Ugh. If it weren't for that, I'd rate this slightly higher.

The overall feel and aesthetic of this movie is top notch and near epic levels. Tony Jaa and Milla's costume/armor and weaponry look incredibly badass. Reminds me of Russel Crowe's Gladiator armor.

Its a fun movie, though there are some scenes that last slightly too long (e.g. the final battle in the film and the cave scene with the spider like monsters)

A much better film than Resident Evil, and I'd put this up there with the 2nd Transformers, and National Treasure 2. Meaning it's good fun, rewatchable, but not quite great.",movies,1614904361,Becksploder,True,0,16,2021-03-04

YouTube-Channels about movie related knowledge and education???,"First of all
I'm really sorry, if this one doesn't belong here, but I think it's the closest I will get on this platform 

I am looking for a YouTube-Channel which basically tells you about making-of stuff in sense of ""this movie/scene is so good, because they used this and that special filming techniques"",""wondered how they do sex-scenes? Here's the trick"", ""ever asked yourself how this effects are made? Here you go!"" or ""this is the golden angle"" and so on
We're basically talking about some in-depth movie-school kind of thing 

Recommendations for channels, which are looking at the narrative or philosophical aspects of certain movies are welcome as well, even though I have to mention, that I'm already watching Wendigoon and Ryan Hollinger, while some kind of Channel as described above is still desperately needed 

Any recommendations are highly appreciated

Why do people like movies at 48fps or 60fps? (Genuine question),"Apologies if this has been asked here before, but I am genuinely curious.

I can recall Peter Jackson's infatuation with 48-frames-per-second while filming *The Hobbit* trilogy, but upon release, the use of 48fps proved (at best) *divisive*. Since then, I can't recall any other films attempting to emulate this method. 

However, as a person who frequently looks up random scenes from films and series on Youtube, I've noticed many HD options offering 4K clarity at 60fps. Personally, I don't own a TV or hardware that offers 4K, but even when I've had access to one that does, and even then when that screen is properly configured, I still can't understand what it is some people find alluring about it. On its own, I can understand the allure of 4K, especially on a nice screen, but 60fps honestly just takes me out of it, to the point I'd rather watch it in standard definition just to avoid it. 

**(Technically TL;DR) Can people who prefer to enjoy movies and series this way explain what they enjoy so much about it? To the point that some also go out of their way to buy nicer hardware to do so?**",movies,1614908018,tomc_23,True,3,20,2021-03-04

Jewel of the Nile is as bad as I remember,"I'm a huge fan of Romancing the Stone, and I've always remembered it's sequel Jewel of the Nile as somewhat of a disappointment.  Well I revisited the film for the first time in about 30 years and time has not made the film any better.  It's like the film makers wanted to do the exact opposite of Romancing the Stone.  Instead of jungle we get desert.  Instead of a jewel we get no treasure.  Instead of adventure we get political bickering.  Instead of humor and suspense we get.. sigh.   
The young writer of the original movie died shortly after the film was made, and that is indeed a tragedy.  They could have at least started with a script that honored her memory, but it looks like they rushed out a film as soon as possible to capitalize on the original's unexpected success rather than try to make a decent followup.  It's not all bad though, the F16 sequence was pretty cool.  But that's about it.",movies,1614725924,raresaturn,True,1,21,2021-03-02

Escape from Pretoria,Pretty recent movie based on an incredible true story. With an great performance from Daniel Radcliffe. I still can't believe this actually happened lol. Its the new great escape! And not 3 hours long lol. Its not particularly anything remarkable but not all movies have to be! It does its job really well and I struggle to find anything wrong with it. There are some REALLY tense scenes in this. I think anybody would enjoy! It is a prime original so I'm sure a lot of you have already seen it on the page.

About Time one of the best films ever made,"Hello,

I never thought I would be saying this about any movie, especially one about time travel. About time is one of those movies that are a dime a dozen; the type of movie to make you rethink your life, your choices, and the way you live. 

The premise of the movie is very simple; Tim, the main protagonist, has the ability to travel back in time to any point in his life and change it. He can't change his life after he has a baby as it changes too much of what he thinks as his present. His family has been able to do this forever and he is just the latest link in the chain.

The message of the movie is eloquently and masterfully done. I am not going to spoil the movie as it's ending needs to be witnessed without spoilers but it made me change my view on life. Full stop.

I always thought I appreciated the moments of my life but after watching I realized I wasn't as well as I should have. We all can't travel back and change the past so live in the moment. Live for the dream each day and make it your dam best day. You have a lifetime to do it but once you get to the end you don't get any do-overs, so make your life filled with little moments that you can look back on and be proud of.

Wake up and start your day full of life and appreciate the world around you. You might missing something new each day so just find it in your life. Even if everyday is the same there is always something that you can look on and be happy about. Live each day as though it were your last.

About Time is a movie about appreciation of the world around you and how you don't get another shot at the day, so make it the most.

If you haven't watched it before I will recommend it beyond a doubt. It is a movie everyone can learn from. It has changed my view on life and it I hope it can in yours. 

About Time is on Netflix and if you don't have Netflix, well there are others to watch. But I highly recommend this movie if you feel lost or just need a minute to breathe. It moves at a solid pace and will leave you in tears. 

Have a beautiful day Reddit.",movies,1614727197,MasterYoshi5,True,1,12,2021-03-02

I have to admit that I am not great at puting how it made me feel into words and sometimes have a hard time following plots.  I enjoyed that everything was not explained every step of the way and spoonfed to the audience. The movie was slow and some would say dragged at times but it was a refreshing change of pace for me. The intense fighting scenes were few and that is okay.

Into the Wild - worth watching?,"I checked the Imdb page before watching and it looked interesting enough. Movie started with a beautiful montage and some cute music. But then, around 15 minutes in, the main character says the lines ""So now comes the final and greatest adventure. The climactic battle to kill the false being within and victoriously conclude the spiritual revolution. No longer to be poisoned by civilization, he flees, and walks alone upon the land to become lost in the wild"". 


Hearing this made me cringe so hard that I had to shut the whole thing off. So my question is: is this just some pseudo-spiritual, fake-deep ""intellectual"" bs, or do you think the movie is good and actually has something to say?

What are some sad but violent (preferably revenge) movies,"There is only one movie which I've seen that fits this bill and it's 'Ghajini':

Ghajini - A wealthy businessman loses his fiance brutally after a large gang kills her, this man is also brutally beaten but survives with retrograde amnesia. He attempts to kill the killers and after a very emotional/dramatic ending fight, he succeeds, but this is all done in a very serious and emotional fashion, ending with him imagining himself next to his fiance. The background score is also amazing in this movie as well.

In short, I want to watch a very sad/emotional/dramatic movie that is centered on revenge/violence (as if the main character lost a love one or something similar), also it would be highly appreciated if the movie also has a good/emotional background score.

(I have already seen John Wick and Death Wish, and I'd say besides the music part, John Wick decently fits the bill, but Death Wish seemed more upbeat and action-oriented rather than emotional.)",movies,1614729243,midnightchristmas,True,1,51,2021-03-02

The Shining was an utter disappointment,"So, I am sure this is a hot take but I wish to actually have some discussion on this and hopefully understand other peoples perspectives: The Shining felt completely devoid of character or plot.  


I managed to stay away from any spoilers for what happened in it, except that it was a classic and was a Kubrick movie that was scary. I watched it recently because I wanted to see Dr. Sleep and it felt like a lifeless movie. Nicholson was phenomenal as per usual (all the acting actually felt well done) but was dislikable from the start. It felt like the movie was supposed to be a character study of his devolution up to what he does at the end (which was so blatantly foreshadowed at the start), but it never felt like that occurred. He was just kinda a shitty dude, then he starts being an ax murderer... He never devolves, it just kinda flips like a switch.  
And all the zombies, and ghosts, and ""the Shining"" of the kid and other guy aren't expanded on in any way... It was beautiful to watch as is Kubrick's style, but the movie was utterly devoid of life or character, and didn't develop a plot of any substance, and at no point feels scary (either ambient or jump scares/shock).  
It definitely isn't a movie I would recommend to anyone, except maybe so you know what the hotel is so you can understand Dr. Sleep better, because holy sh\*t was THAT an amazing movie!",movies,1614729523,CrisplyCooked,True,1,63,2021-03-02

District 9 is still one of my fav sci- fi,"this is a random post but I just rewatched this again on crackle and I love this movie man. I’m not huge into scifi like some but I like it enough if it’s compelling material wether book, media, show, video game etc etc. 

crazy it came out in 2009 time flies man feel like this came out yesterday, 2009 even feels like a very different time than today. Idk the purpose of this post but I just love the realistic vibe this movie instills ya know. I believe it’s one of those films that’s great but you can’t pinpoint exactly why it’s great.

 It always felt like a book movie to me as in it make a great book if written story wise. I feel like the scenarios show both sides of the aliens and humans bad and good sides And really plunges the main character into a melting of sides from humanity to alien is compelling and done well. It shows there is always two sides to a story. It paints the characters very well in terms of it breaks that action Hollywood cliche of predictability as you don’t know wether the main character is gonna die or win or succeed  or what.   


random post so sorry if I broke any rules just thought I’d reflect here on this gem of a film even over a decade later.",movies,1614730206,Consistent-Ad-9153,True,1,257,2021-03-02

Oldest movie with actor/actress still alive?,"In [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/l9asnk/oldest_movie_with_actoractress_still_alive/) thread I asked what is the oldest movie with an actor (in a credited role) still alive, after the passing of Don Marion Davis, discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/l96bhe/last_actoractress_with_a_credited_role_in_a/).

I thought it was Cora Sue Collins, but I was wrong, that special title goes to:

Marilyn Knowlden:

[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0461490/](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0461490/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t6)

[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022574/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0022574/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_31)

I think that in itself is an interesting fact and when Marilyn dies, then the ""title"" passes to Cora Sue (if she is still living)...maybe someone should make a list of oldest movies with living cast members...note that just from 1 death it went from 1922 (Don Marion) to 1931, a considerable age gap.",movies,1614730585,pedrito77,True,1,8,2021-03-02

Whenever he pops up on this subreddit it is inevitably because is he is perceived to be on some other level, but according to the video above this can be broken down into a creative decision by Cage and therefore seems worthy to me that in fact Cage is far more intelligent and creative than he is given credit for.

Notice that Elena doesn't mention her *mother's father -* our first hero, Will. Why? Is it because he committed suicide and ""wallowed"" in the tragedies of life?

Saw Greenland the Other Day and Cried.,"I am a sucker for end-of-the-world and disaster movies. Deep Impact, 2012, Day after Tomorrow.. I see them all. When i saw the trailer for this movie i thought - Hey, now Gerard Butler is getting typecast in disaster movies (looking at you GeoStorm, a stupid movie). Then seeing the reviews I was surprised and then decided to watch with a big pinch of salt for those reviewers. It was surprisingly good. I was glued to the seat all the time, very tense moments, humane moments that broke me many times. But the kid asking ""Where are the flashes"" in the bunker broke me like a twig and i cried big manly tears. Looking back at the movie i can see the script was planned well. They setup that moment and paid off perfectly. The wife has her own agency in the character, and kid is not the annoying kid character just to do stupid stuff and drive the plot. Kid having diabetes was an important plot point, but did not become the main thing like it would be in a lesser movie.",movies,1614699149,horror_fan,True,1,5,2021-03-02

1917 is one of the first movies to make me cry.,"I had been putting off watching it because I usually don't go for war movies, just not really my thing. I finally sat down to watch it alone. Now I absolutely regret not seeing it in theaters since it was mind blowing. The idea that it's all one-take ( I know there's cuts and stuff but it's shot like a single continuous shot) kind of put me off when I first started watching but it hooked me in. The lead actors worked very well together and were incredibly natural with how they interacted. 

It's also such a simple premise too, just 2 lads trying to navigate their way down the front lines to deliver a message from their superiors. But all of the heart-renching scenes mixed with the beautiful cinematography got to me.

I've only really teared up at times from movies but by the end of this one I actually cried hard from the whole experience.

Which actor or filmmaker had the most embarrassing '80s?,"[Musicians](https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2013/11/bob-dylan-1980s-songs-boxed-set) were infamous for embarrassing themselves in the '80s:

""That decade, alas, was the shoal upon which so many classic rock acts ran aground. Dylan, Paul McCartney, Neil Young, Stevie Wonder, the Rolling Stones—all released arguably their worst-ever music in the 80s. Why? I blame the unfortunate confluence of baby-boom artists reaching their mid-life crisis years at the precise moment popular music was staggering through one its most vapid eras. Surely it didn’t help that record producers were just learning how to use new digital technologies while they and musicians were simultaneously ingesting mountains of cocaine.""

As for actors, Roy Schneider practically fell off the planet. I blame Friedkin for bad-mouthing him: ""He stated that casting Roy Scheider in the lead was the worst casting decision he has ever made. Although he felt Scheider is a good actor who did a great job, he is only interesting in a film as a ""second or third banana, he's not a star.""

But how is his acting? He's got 2 Oscar nods for films for like Ali nd The Pursuit of Happiness. Might seem like ages ago when he was not only charismatic but showing off terrific range. Look at his career going from rapper to sitcom star to movie star to Oscar nominee to star on the wane.

The movie was well done. Cheesy music and definitely had some exaggerated teen awkwardness, but had good animated scenes and good visuals with a fun plot that mostly moved at a good pace. 

The story reminded me a bit of the movie Everyday where a being wakes up in a different persons body everyday. That movie also used the premise to illustrate the awkwardness of adolescence and feeling like a stranger in your body and life, plus some heartfelt romance. It also had the fat kid from Spider-Man who is a joy to watch.

There isn't like one channel that has a consistent feed of the reviews, but you can find most of their reviews on YouTube and it's a real blast from the past. The production of the show's intros brings back a nostalgic feeling for me having watched these when I was a kid.

The show doesn't get better than when they start arguing about something.

Does anyone ever get stressed over the number of movies there are in relation to the little time available?,"Bear with me, this might sound silly.

About a year ago I started getting into movies. I was inspired by the classics, the underrated, the one-hit-wonders. I quickly piled up a long, long, LONG list of movies I wanted to see. In the beginning, it was fine. I watched when I could, and enjoyed the movies that I saw. But then I began to really get into the community. I watched videos and read articles on movies and people's ratings. I engrossed myself in film YouTubers who posted ""What I watched this month"" videos and watched video essays. Each movie I saw in the newspaper, each movie that was coming out in a month, each movie that one person recommended because it's their favorite, I added to my list. I liked it until I quickly became very stressed that I'm not watching enough movies and the right ones. My 100 list became 200, and then 300, and then 400, and a list of 500 movies. Only having seen about 70 of them. Don't even get me started on foreign films. I hadn't even considered them until a few months ago.

What's worse is hearing other's opinions on certain movies and hearing them catch something you didn't. It feels like I watched that movie and got nothing valuable out of it.

March 2, 2021 is **[Wonder Boys](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185014/)** - 2000

Curtis Hanson wrote the adaptation and directed L.A. Confidential, winning him an Oscar for directing. Five years later he directed Eminem in the Oscar-winning movie 8 Mile. 14 years prior, [he directed Rorshach in a movie about going to Mexico and losing his virginity.](https://youtu.be/E1k5Y7lLnms) But - in between L.A. Confidential and 8 Mile, he made another movie, one that doesn't get enough attention in my humble opinion.

Wonder Boys is was written by [the guy](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0460141/) who later wrote all of the Harry Potter films, and based on a novel by Michael Chabon.

It's mostly about one weekend in the life of a literary professor, and navigating his relationships, his students, and in the insanity of his publisher.

Like most of the movies I recommend, I can't find a good trailer link. [This one is ridiculous with its reviews.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO_sXk-lR7A). Maybe [just watch this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMASxQ-lsB0) and get its vibe.

Ant-Man, Spider-Man, and Iron Man run around with Tom Cruise's wife and Marge Gunderson. It's drenched in writing themes and the book world, it's funny, and Michael Douglas is awesome.

Shadow in the Clouds Review.,"Now this movie has gotten a lot of bad rep from what it looks like due to the physics and plot.

And imma just say this yes some of the stuff in it is like a bit odd and the plot isn’t exactly the best. 

But it’s suppose to be a sci-fi action pack entertainment. Not a history lesson or science lesson on the law of physics and again like I said it’s Sci-fi and usually they don’t have the best of physics and sometimes the plots can be not the best for an example of an older show called stargate how one guy died and went into an higher existence and came back to life. It’s not suppose to make sense it’s suppose to be filled with action and explosions and all to keep you entertained.

Now acting wise the guys they weren’t exactly the best actors but Chloe was an amazing actor and she owned that role! And the CGI was actually really good and not just look like plastic or something it was really good and some of the art style for it was great.

Overall I give it a 4.3 rating. I suggest renting it rather than buying it and possibly watch it with someone it’s better like that.",movies,1614710894,RadGhostKillz,True,1,13,2021-03-02

Frog Dreaming 1985 AKA The Quest and GO Kids,"This seems to be a pretty rare movie now, in the U.S. it was simply called The Quest kind of a boring title.

Is there a worse book adaptation than World War Z? I’d like to find out.,"WWZ the book is an absolute fun favourite of mine - as logically constructed and thought out as any book about zombies could possibly be.  There were many “Oh yeah!  That makes sense!” moments about zombie behaviour, physiology, the methods we’d have to use to deal with them, etc. that it seemed very thoughtful and (for the genre) realistic. 

Aside from the title, the movie bears NO resemblance to the book, except maybe for one or two brief scenes.  The zombies are completely different, the characters, the settings (mostly), the bizarre resolution, and the entire structure of the film are completely different. 

It is the MOST inaccurate movie adaptation of a novel I’ve ever seen.     Are there others that different that I’ve missed?",movies,1614208093,Zarnywoop,True,26,401,2021-02-24

Find the name of this film for me please?,"Hey, sorry if this is the wrong part of Reddit to post this in, feel free to point me in another direction.

I remember watching a film in the 90s (so it'll be 90s or before) (I was young at the time and shocked, so it stuck with me but I think it was WAY too old for me so this is an older rated movie). I can only remember random vague bits and years later I've tried to research it several times but can't ever find anything that matches the info so maybe someone here can help?

Here's all I remember (sorry for vagueness, as I said it was a long time ago and I was too young) (sorry for any spoilers, if ""vague unknown film"" can be spoiled): 

There's a woman suffering with a phobia or PTSD or something about the colour red. She adopts (or fosters some children? a child?). (a girl?) is OCD about washing her hands, so her hands/skin go red with scrubbing or due to a reaction?. And the woman freaks out when she notices this. And (either that scene or something else further along) there's a flashback to (some traumatic thing? I can't remember) and it is explained why she can't stand the colour red, because of the trauma.",movies,1614218202,1990chasethesun,True,1,24,2021-02-24

So you snuggle in for some light romance and time travel. This is nice.

Wrong.

Richard pulled a sneaky one on ya. This isn't about romance at all. It's about a dad with terminal cancer using time travel to spend more time with his son before he dies. And you're about to ugly cry REAL hard.

Citizen Kane the best film ever made?,"Citizen Kane is often refered to as ""the best and most well-crafted film of all time"" or one of the best. Do you personally agree or disagree with that? 

I've rewatched it today and damn it's easily noticeable how it changed the game when you compare it to movies released before, but I can't say I *really* enjoy the movie. I appreciate more how technically great Kane is and how it shaped modern cinema than I actually like its characters or the story. Maybe someday it will finally click and I'll also say it's one of the best movie ever, or not. The latter is most likely. But anyway, the legacy is undeniable",movies,1614221070,lonesome__,True,0,69,2021-02-24

Can i rant about Birdman for a minute?,"In particular the incredibly magical scene when Norton first shows up. They begin talking about the play and the dialogue, and they return to the scene that was previously running with the other actor.  

So they go over the scene briefly, discuss the lines that are being run and the thing evolves so organically from lines being mechanically regurgitated to an organic feeling about the conversation. It flows so fluidly and it really draws me into the story, that one scene and the back and forth that happens. 

I showcases how mediocre the previous actor was and how fantastically organic Nortons character and his ability to perform is. It's a perfect introduction to his character.",movies,1614222990,Phempteru,True,15,47,2021-02-24

This is what gets left out in the discussions people have about VHS in 2021.,"Every once in awhile we hear some hype about VHS, either in the news or on YouTube, etc. However, I wanted to make a point about VHS that I don't hear discussed as often as it should be. And in my view is the most powerful argument for the medium.   


In my view, the most interesting content found on VHS tapes aren't movies or commercially released productions, it's the things people recorded at home. A home recorded VHS tape can contain the most rare content found on Earth. For example, if you have a VHS tape where someone recorded 6 uninterrupted hours of MTV in 1993, you will most likely never find that block of television anywhere else, no matter how hard you look. Not only do the tapes contain the shows or movies, they also often contain commercials, bumpers, and promos that are by and large lost to the wastes of time.   


I understand that nostalgia is a big factor for VHS, but to me I don't get a big nostalgia high from watching Jurassic Park on VHS. There are way better ways to watch movies like that in much higher quality. However, if you have a home recording of Jurassic Park broadcast on television, it's a perfect little time capsule. And again, chances are you're the only person in existence to possess that exact recording.   


These recordings are becoming harder to come by, every year countless thousands of them make their way to the landfill. We're running out of time to preserve these things. Yet, all too often, when people get into VHS they go for the low hanging fruit and commercially released movies that were made by the millions and are readily available on thrift store shelves.   


I'm just here to say that if you have any interest in VHS, you might want to consider using the medium for what makes it truly unique. Home recorded tapes.",movies,1614034377,adultlunchables,True,1,58,2021-02-22

What is some of the worst recast decisions that you have seen in movies?,"There not a lot to choose from just from the movies I have seen but one does come to heart when I ever I think of it. So, one of my favorite nostalgic movies as a kid was the Mummy series With Brendan Fraser. I think very bland actor just from an acting stand point and that he just has been in alot of movies to judge him from but the charisma with other co-star Rachel Weisz. There dialogue just worked so well together. But, as soon as third one came out and she was replace by Maria Bello I could never think about the mummy franchise again. I still watch watch the mummy anytime it comes on but will always remember how they ruined the series for me. 

I would like to know everyone else opinion on this. Also it could be different voice actors for different movies also.",movies,1614034566,abdul_bino,True,1,32,2021-02-22

I finally watched The Terminator {1984},"I really love sci-fi movies like Alien, Aliens, Total Recall, and Predator, so I was really interested in The Terminator, and after watching it it's easily one of the best sci-fi movies ever made, I would say the only flaw with this movie is being overshadowed by the greatest sequel of all time.

The performances are all just so strong in this movie, especially Arnold as the T-800, he is just so threatening, the way he moves his eyes before moving his head is a very nice touch, and his robotic movements like his head turns really sell you on the fact he is a machine, Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese is just as amazing as Arnold, Reese feels like a vey traumatized person, and Linda Hamilton is very believable as a person thrust into a very bizarre situation.

Despite its low budget, most of the effects have stood the test of time, there are only a few dated effects, the scene where the T-800 cuts its eye out has a very obvious animatronic Arnie head, but other than that the rest of the effects hold up very well, the stop motion T-800, which some may say looks very dated, IMO adds a layer of creepiness to the terminator, The Terminator really cemented Stan Winston as the go to guy for special effects.

Brad feidals music for the movie sounds very 80s, some may say this is a bad thing, but I think it adds a layer of charm to the movie, the best tracks are in the tech noir shootout and the police station shootout, the soundtrack adds more layers of horror to the already horror feel of the movie, IMO Brad is a very underrated composer and its a shame he has left the movie industry.

If you are sci-fi fan and you have seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to watch it, it has great acting, music, effects, and overall its just a classic.",movies,1614037321,ExtentWorldly7928,True,1,109,2021-02-22

Pound for pound best actor: Peter H. Dinklage,"So, probably offensive reference to size aside, guy is seriously GOOD.  I know he got more consideration after GoT, but that role doesn't show him at his best.  I have not seen him really fill the screen as a leading role, but he has saved a fair number of pictures with disappointing lead actors.  Watching ""I care a lot"" and Rosamund Pike, who I will admit I don't like to begin with, is not doing much for me.  Every scene with Dinklage has been a joy though.  And he is playing some sort of Russian mob boss at 4' 5"", and he doesn't seem at all out of place.  The role does not seem at all written for a dwarf.  It is really somewhat absurd how natural he is making it look.

I'll start. I'd really love a David Bowie movie (I know Stardust recently came out but I've heard it's really bad and worst of all contains 0 Bowie songs). He's one of the most fantastic figures of the 20th century. He's had a really interesting career spanning from the 60s when he was out releasing covers under the name Davy Jones, up until the mid 2010s when he made possibly the best final record of any artist ever while battling cancer.

Desperately Trying to Find this Asian Film,I was scrolling the internet (probably reddit) a few months ago and I came across a battle scene from an Asian movie that was absolutely awesome.  I have spent the last few months trying to figure out which movie it was so I could watch the full film and enjoy it.  Super high production value movie.  I'm not sure what language the movie was in but it was not English but had English subtitles.  The scene was of a huge CGI aided ancient battle scene probably in China.  It seemed like it was probably a newer movie as the CGI was pretty good and definitely had a huge budget.  Please reply with some possibilities for what movie this was.

What is a mediocre film you’ve seen that you believe if remade could be something special and why?,"I recently watch Brian De Palma’s 1978 film “The Fury” starring Kirk Douglas and Amy Irving in a genre bending horror/sci-fi/thriller mashup. I loved the concept of this film, a telekinetic youth abducted from his father for potential nefarious reasons and the father’s quest to find his missing son.

However, the film is very disjointed. At first, focusing on a over the hill Kirk Douglas trying to play action hero. Despite his age and some cliche terrorist aside, I actually enjoyed the first thirty so minutes of this film and the music of John Williams is one point as always. However, Kirk Douglas is pretty much abandon a 1/4 of the way through the film and we are paired up with actress Amy Irving who serves as the protagonist for the rest of the film. 

Her introduction at first is interesting, but soon it grinds the film to a halt and it never recovers in my opinion. They film chooses to focus on her instead of the son which I feel was the first mistake. The second is sidelining Kirk Douglas till near the end of the film. I believe this film has the barebones to be a winner if remade. It has political conspiracy, psychological sci-fi and some real gory horror for the era. It felt like a horror heavy X-Men film mixed with something akin to Enemy of the State. With so many solid films being remade in mediocre copies, I’d like to see some undercooked first outings be rebooted into something special.

"If you're a fan of guilty pleasures B-movies like Iron Sky or Overlord, give a try to Shadow in the Cloud (2020)","We've got basically two movies mashed in one script : one is a tense, amazingly shot and acted claustrophobic feminist movie in the gun bunk of a B-52 over Midway. The other stars a completely miscast babyface Chloe Moretz on a synthwave soundtrack doing her best impression of a grizzled Amelia Earheart against a CGI gremlin.

It's legit one of the weirdest movies I've seen, veering in the so-bad-it's-good territory of some of Cage's or Seagal's finest works, like somebody wanted to write *Nomadland* and stopped Midway (ahah) to watch Commando. It's as stupid and enjoyable as it sounds.

Some moments just made roar with glee, like when she spends 10mn outside of the B-52, crawling back and forth under its belly acting like it's the most normal thing to do. Or that scene towards the end of the movie where &gt;!the crew finds themselves stranded on a Pacific island, surrounded by Japanese troops, and Chloe Moretz's boyfriend drops to his knees to propose her absolutely out of nowhere, and the gremlin pops behind and fucks off with their baby in a satchel only to get [pummelled to death by a woman half his size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbnf08pP4RQ).!&lt;

I feel like the hatred for Cars 2 overshadow how good the Orginal Film is,"My girlfriend and I are watching all the Pixar movies in order and we were not looking forward to tonight's film, the first Cars. I was honestly shocked by how much I enjoyed the film. I havent seen any if the cars movies since the 3rd one came out back in 2017 and I feel like with that being the last cars film I watched made this one so much more enjoyable. Seeing the parallels between the two boosted my experience. The film is drop dead gorgeous, watching the Pixar films in order and seeing the progress made in computer animated films is wonderful to see. I feel like they really perfected reflections and shine with this film. I feel like Lightning is a very relatable character, and I think the film does an amazing job showing him actually growing as a character. I also think the supporting cast is also amazing! Paul Newman's Doc Hudson is a clear standout in the film. His arch is also amazing and compliments Owen Wilson's Lightning perfectly.

Yes we all know Cars 2 is not the best, but I think i lot of the hatred pours over until the other 2 films in franchise. Cars was a really fun film and I don't think it gets enough love.

 After seeing 7 of the Pixar films so far, I would definitely put it  in 3rd place.

Help! I can't remember the name of this movie...,"Hello all!

Hopefully, someone on this sub will recognize what I can remember about the movie in question and will finally put an end to me wracking my brain for clues about what this movie could possibly be called. I don't have too many details that I can remember, but here goes:

From what I do recall, the movie was about a guy who moved into a nice suburban neighborhood near a family of four; a couple and their two young children(a girl and a boy, definitely older than toddlers but not yet preteens, perhaps 8ish years old). I wanna say that the new guy looked a lot like the actor Jason O'Mara but I have discounted that it may actually be him based on my scouring of his IMDb page.  Think white, maybe 25-30 years old and dark haired, handsome maybe?

Anyway, Jason O'Mara lookalike moves into the neighborhood and becomes obsessed with the woman next door and begins stalking her, and her family. I remember he killed their dog(a Golden Retriever, I believe) and buried its body under some shrubs. I think she had a friend that came around at some point and everyone thought the lady's dog was just missing or had run away. I am somewhat certain that he killed the dog because it barked at him and interrupted his stalker activities.

I cannot for the life of me remember any more of the film, which may have been a TV movie on Lifetime or something, and I must've still been a kid when I saw it. It didn't seem like an old-timey movie at all, it was in color, they had phones but I don't remember any other technology being used that might pinpoint a particular decade, etc.

I also vaguely remember him stalking them from INSIDE their own house, like through their attic or something, but I can't be certain. It's not a lot to go on, but I appreciate anyone who stops and reads this. Thank you!",movies,1614046581,jabilak,True,1,9,2021-02-22

Help me please for the love of God.,"UPDATE: I Got It!! It was Adventures in Dinosaur City. Thanks everyone for your help!

I’m trying to remember a movie I saw as a kid. It was about some kids or teenagers from our world, going into a world of dinosaur people. NOT Super Mario Bros lol and not They’re Back but sort of like a reverse They’re Back??? And the dinosaurs might have been puppets cause I remember it being pretty visceral like it wasn’t bouncy cartoon animation. 

Also they may have teleported there through the tv screen but maybe I’m imagining that part? Did the kids BECOME dinosaurs?? Don’t remember but maybe something like that?? This has been driving me crazy. I thought it might be that Dinosaurs sitcom with the puppet characters but I don’t think that’s it, that premise is not what I remember at all. It was a more kind of Disney channel-quality fantasy adventure type dealio.

"Les Miserables, the 2012 Musical","First of all, I am a huge fan of the original unabridged book by Victor Hugo. It is long, heavy, and occasionally meandering. But in my opinion, it is one of the greatest stories ever written.

I have seen the Musical, on stage, half a dozen or so times. The story is told well, and I love the music.

Les Miserable has been made into a film many times previously. There was a silent film in 1934 and a version from the 1990's where Liam Neeson played John Valjohn (""During my stay in the prisons of France, I developed a 'special' set of skills..."")

When I learned there would be a musical version of the movie. I was excited. I anticipated that the music would be scored and presented in full Surround Sound. The story could be told as a full panoramic epic. I envisioned that they would use massive locations to tell this story. The cast selection sounded like it would be spectacular.

Like I said, I was excited.

As I recall, the movie opened in the US on Christmas day. Late that afternoon, I packed up the family and we went to the movies.

The music was great, the acting was great, everything was fine. But I thought that I was going to see a Stage Show transformed onto the large screen in a epic production. Unfortunately, that did not happen.

The sound quality was as though the guy up in the camera booth had forgotten to push the button that said ""Use more than 2 speakers"". It was abysmal. I heard better sound listening to AM radio in my car.

And there were a few scenes, like the opening at the prison ships, and the initial pan-out at the Abby, and the final pan-out at the barricade where they actually made full use of the wide screen.  
But other than those few exceptions, for some strange reason (maybe they blew the entire budget hiring the actors?), they shot the entire movie as though they were acting on a small stage. I felt like the director brought a few camera crews to a Broadway show and then filmed the entire movie from the audience.

I recently re-watched it on DVD, hoping my wide-screen TV would make it work. I still found myself experiencing frequent feelings of disappointment. It could have been so much more.

tl;dr: I was disappointed with the 2012 musical version of the film.",movies,1613860232,Bud_McGinty,True,0,8,2021-02-20

Secret of NIMH (1982) feels like a first draft of a potential masterpiece.,"So I just finished it and I recommend it heavily due to the second half's dark nature. But it just feels like a movie that needed some major improvements with the story structure. Too many characters are not fleshed out enough (Jonathan Brisby, The Great Owl, Nicodemus, Jenner), certain concepts needed more development (why Nicodemus has magic, maybe more about NIMH), and too many comedic sequences are filler in a very short run time (too much of Jeremy unfortunately).

"The rest of the franchise notwithstanding, First Blood is a brilliant movie","Over the decades, many have dismissed the Rambo movies (perhaps fairly) as revenge violence porn.  For those who haven’t seen the original in a long while, or ever, it is worth your time. 

John Rambo is an intensely sympathetic character, played with subtle detail by Stallone in his prime.  The first scenes impart the backstory in a not heavy handed way, as he learns the fate of his war buddy.

Rambo isn’t looking for trouble, but he’s also not going out of his way to be polite in his first encounter with Brian Dennehy’s small-town sheriff.  He owes no one anything, certainly not excuses for his shabby appearance.

The middle acts progress mostly at Dennehy’s direction.  Both characters are very real; Stallone, no white knight, punches back harder than is perhaps justified.  Dennehy (eventually) seems more focused on protecting his town - however misguided - from what he perceives as a madman, than on extracting revenge.  (The Richard Crenna character ended up being weaker than I remembered; curious if any recent watchers feel the same?)

Stallone’s final soliloquy is crushing.  The story he recounts is not some grand essay on the war, but rather a brutal, messy incident which he’s carried with him for years.  It was a wise screenwriting decision to go small here.  Rambo’s not trying to solve the war; he’s trying to find personal peace. 

This is a story, more than anything, about PTSD, before that condition was widely known or discussed.  There is some gratuity, to be sure, but a movie’s allowed to be a movie.  Overall, it’s a gut-wrenching look on the state of a post-war country.

- Exploring people who are conflicted and want to be free of the repression, 
- A film about the Scraps that live underground and how their society functions, 
- Perhaps a movie about how Taco Bell beat out McDonald's to become the only fast food restaurant.
- The unseen side-effects of living in a perfect society.
- What else can't this society handle, other than crime?

It's a question to those who really enjoyed the trilogy. Despite the story (for what I've heard) being really well made, I just cannot get into it at all. 

At its core, excluding the first movie (which I watched) where you get to see the relationship between Cesar and his ""owner"" the other ones are essentially war within a world destroyed by apes who just want to become their own entities by messing shit up instead of opening dialogue.

You're supposed (?) to dislike the humans for their attempts at stirring shit up so they can reclaim their society and in the end they literally become extinct and the apes have this bittersweet ending.

It's most likely because of my personality, but I just can't stand watching a movie where you're essentially watching humanity get shit on constantly. 

Did I miss something? Was the point of the trilogy to show how war leads to more destruction and how dialogue could've led to a better future for both parties?

I'd love if someone could explain!",movies,1613863495,Frank_Cap,True,3,21,2021-02-20

There will be blood - symbolism.,"I rewatched there will be blood and I noticed something I didn't notice the first time I watched it.

In the final scene where daniel and eli are in the bowling alley of daniels house, there is a part where Daniel is beating Eli to death with a bowling pin.

When I saw this part again, the camera angle of the first shot is looking up at Daniel and the bowling pin and Eli are out of view. When I saw this, it struck me as if the shot was made to look like Daniel could be digging for oil similar to how he was using his hammer tool in the opening sequence of the movie.

Then the second shot shows Eli's head with blood pooling - which looks like oil pooling.

If this was intended - I imagine Daniel digging for oil and Daniel killing Eli are metaphors for each other.

My take on this metaphor is that instead of striking oil - he's struck blood. Meaning the oil is finished - there's only blood left. Which might be why he says ""I'm finished"" at the end. Because he's got all the money he wants and hes got the revenge he wanted. He has no relatives or people he loves in his life. He's finished.

I'm curious to hear other people's thoughts around this.",movies,1613864988,arabcel,True,0,10,2021-02-20

Which movies have the best worldbuilding?,"Worldbuilding is the process of developing a detailed and plausible fictional world.   

With other mediums like novels, video games or even TV shows, I think they're at an advantage because they're far less limited for time constraints to flesh out their worlds, whereas in film, you're looking at anything from an hour and a half to 3 hours of screen time.   

The main standout to me is Blade Runner (1982). When people talk about the ""atmosphere"" in this movie, they're usually talking about the worldbuilding. I don't enjoy this movie much for the narrative, but absolutely love the world they created. It felt very lived in and believable, and was obviously a massive inspiration for sci-fi worlds in general.   

I also think Mad Max: Fury Road did an exceptional job at subtle worldbuilding. With it being all action and essentially no exposition, it takes a much more background approach, leaving things for the viewer to piece together by themselves rather than beating them over the head with it:   

https://kmalexander.com/2015/06/24/mad-max-fury-road-and-the-art-of-worldbuilding/

Which movie has aged poorly?,"X-Men almost feels like a cheap TV pilot looking at it through the lens of all the superhero movies made in the 17 years since.

There's so little action, and when it does happen, it feels very restrained and basic. The climax in the Statue of Liberty is a slow, disorganized series of one-on-one fights where the characters use their powers sparingly, make really lame jokes, and generally take their sweet fuckin' time stopping Magneto. People complain about newer superhero movies spending too much time on one-liners when the world is supposedly in danger, but this is the granddaddy of that trend without any question.

You could argue the point of the film is the characters and not the action, but the character work isn't *that* good either. Comparing it to Logan is practically cheating but even looking at the other X-men movies Brian Singer directed, the first just feels boxed-in and dull whether they're fighting or talking.",movies,1613865689,ayubnor,True,0,71,2021-02-20

Game Night (2018),"This movie surprised me. It was so much better than I thought it would be. It's easily one of the best comedies I've seen in recent years. It wasn't just funny, it was consistently funny from beginning to end and that really impressed me. The [Denzel Washington scene](https://youtu.be/E3DL5eyYvro) might be the hardest I've ever laughed during a movie. 

I loved how the movie didn't stick to a genre. It's a comedy but it's also an action thriller, a heist movie, a buddy cop movie, a romantic comedy, and a family drama. I was impressed with how well they blended all these elements together into a fun and entertaining movie. It was refreshing to watch a movie that didn't feel like it needed it define itself as one genre and then stick to the conventions of that genre. 

The [egg chase](https://youtu.be/ODiSR2160dI) made this movie go from good to great for me. I love that scene. It's so well directed. The camera movements across rooms, floors, and balconies were incredible.",movies,1613865965,paull___,True,6,234,2021-02-20

Something that bothers me in war movies is unnecessary infidelity or “moving on” stories of wives (sometimes husbands too). Can you relate?,"Before people jump on me... yes, I understand that this was a reality during the world wars (well, war in general), and I’m not asking that movies go the other way and pretend like everything was hunky dory. 

And don’t get me wrong, I understand why women would have been open to marrying/being with other men while their husbands and such were deployed, knowing they might not come back. But I feel like in war movies, it’s always handled in a poor way and just comes off kinda grim and depressing, especially since such movies are usually supposed to be about heroes. 

I can understand it’s use in movies like Jarhead where the whole point of the movie is to sort of dispel the myth that war is glorious or fun or cool. But some movies and shows will introduce female characters who we are supposed to like and follow throughout the story and while the movie or episodes focus on her hubby or bf, we keep cutting back to some guy on leave wooing her only for the other dude to come back later and find he’s out of luck. I just find it really hard to enjoy those scenes (although to be honest I’d rather the whole movie focus on the soldiers not civilians anyway). 

And I’m not in some way triggered or anything like that, I’m not “offended” I just find subplots like that really make it harder to engage with the story. And to be honest, I’m not a fan of infidelity as a plot device unless the whole story revolves around it so I’m probably biased here. Am I alone?",movies,1613867976,AA005555,True,4,25,2021-02-20
Under The Silver Lake: My Interpretation,"In Under the Silver Lake, is it possible that Sam is gender dysphoric? Could he be a “girl trapped in a man’s body” and doesn’t recognize it? Could his masturbation addiction and obsessive sexual desire after certain women be a sign of a subconscious desire to be like them? I wondered this after I noticed his buddy Allen wearing a female blouse while at the rooftop party. He seems to be more self actualized while Sam has no direction. The only close relationship he has is with his mother. From what I’ve read, people with gender identification issues tend to identify as the opposite sex possibly because of being raised mostly by the opposite gender parent.

I’m probably reading WAY to deep into it but I can’t help but want this to be the case because otherwise it’s just a Vertigo ripoff about “misogyny”.

"A ghost movie where some college (?) kids rent a house, I think they have a party or something and there's a shitty clown doll?","I watched this movie with my sister and her boyfriend a couple years back, and I keep remembering scenes but I don't remember what it was called. A bunch of kids, some dudes, some girls rent a house or move into one or whatever. I think they were all young adults, and they might've had a pool party where one of the guys noticed a clown on their balcony, but it had bright colours and was in the daylight so it wasn't at all scary to watch. The clown was a really bad doll, and in my memory it looks like some kind of inflatable pool toy. I think some of these kids were also having sex or something in their bedrooms and the clown showed up again and did some spooky stuff. If I remember correctly, the house was on a pretty steep hill in what looked like high class Californian suburbia with a brick driveway. There was definitely a scene where a girl drove up this driveway, I think it was probably the landlord.",movies,1613868148,shroom_business,True,1,5,2021-02-20

Help me pick movies for immigrant parents to help them better understand pop culture,"Hello! 

So once a week I have a movie night with my parents. We alternate choosing movies, and I want to choose culturally significant movies so they can understand references their coworkers make and just have a better understanding of North American culture (also because I don’t watch many movies either).

I started with the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies, then Forrest Gump and Groundhogs day.

Some movies they’ve already seen:

Avatar, Titanic, Shawshanks Redemption, Saving Private Ryan, various Marvel movies, Singing in the rain, JoJo Rabbit, and most Audrey Hepburn and Shirley Temple movies. 

I’m thinking of watching the Godfather movies next (then maybe Star Wars?). 

Their English is quite good (and they’re going to watch with subtitles anyways), so what other movies should I get them to watch? 

I’d prefer ones that have quotable lines or notable characters so if it’s brought up in a conversation they get what’s going on.

Thank you!

"Who is ""I Care A Lot"" even for? [spoilerish]","Like its a pretty good movie, but it feels like it doesn't know its audience imo. 

Almost every male character other than Dinklage is at least somewhat misogynistic, so it's kind of framed like a feminist power movie, but how could anyone actively root for someone who traps old people into a legal spiderweb to rob them? Like there's no way to justify that at all. Misogyny is clearly bad there's no argument there, but effectively kidnapping, trapping, and milking old people to death is notably more evil? It'd be like if there was a movie about Hitler, but the movie just focused on how much he loved animals and hated smoking. That's an extreme example, yet, I guess those things are good but there's a blood-soaked elephant in the room here. 

And you might say that you're not supposed to be on her side your supposed to be on Dinklage's, but the movie isn't super there either? If it was Dinklage would have gotten revenge on Marla by the end but that doesn't really happen. 

It's like the first half of the movie you're on Dinklage and his Mom's side, but then the second half they kind of ignore the two of them, (especially the Mom, played by Dianne Wiest), and instead try to somehow humanize Marla by focusing on her and her girlfriend's relationship? But I already hate Marla, her girlfriend, and anyone involved with their scheme so again, who's side am I supposed to be on? 

It reminds me a lot of ""Nightcrawler,"" where you have a morally dubious protag, but Nightcrawler pulls it off by having Gyllenhall's character actually be likable for the first half of the movie until they slowly reveal the lengths he's ready to go to, but by then you already like his character so you're actually conflicted. 

Another problem the movie seems to have is under usage of certain characters, most notably a lawyer and Wiest's character. The Lawer, played by Dean Ericson, is, like a few other male characters, misogynistic. This however doesn't stop him from being somewhat charming and stealing the show whilst on screen, yet he is only seen in about 3 scenes over the course of about 30 minutes in a two-hour movie. And Wiest similarly, steals every scene she's in, before being reduced to a forgotten mcguffin in the second half of the film. 

All this aside it is, again, a pretty good movie. Dinklage steals every scene he's in, as does Wiest, Rosamund Pike's (Marla's) acting is also very stellar and is never bad, not to mention the shot work and the soundtrack are just phenomenal all throughout, but the movie just feels like it looses a very noticeable portion of its momentum halfway through. 

Just curious if anyone else had a similar take to the film.",movies,1613870747,unicorn_feces33,True,0,115,2021-02-20

Mortal Kombat deserves more than a campy action flick.,"With the trailer for the new Mortal Kombat I have seen lots of comments saying it looks like a bad dumb movie or that it takes itself too seriously and all you need for a good Mortal Kombat movie is good action and camp. I disagree. I think the reason why previous video game adaptations failed is because they did not take the original source with the respect they deserved, video games as an intullectual property and an art form need to be taken seriously to be a good film and not a bad action flick to give to the nerds.

And I think it looks like a great action film that Mortal Kombat deserves. I think Mortal Kombat as a series is way past being popcorn entertainment and should be conveyed through serious tones and emotional support, which I am glad the movie is going for alongside its more cheeky comedic references to the games.

Video games have been established as a serious art form recently more than ever so I'm hoping that we are way past days of lazy video game adaptations and Mortal Kombat, Borderlands, Uncharted and Last of Us all look like they have full dedication behind them, and I have little stigma.",movies,1613689471,Mortalily,True,1,33,2021-02-18
"Spike Lee's 2006 ""INSIDE MAN"" must have what is the most perfectly planned bank heist of any film that would have the best chance of ACTUALLY WORKING IN REAL LIFE","Note, I'm not talking about ""the best heist movie"". I've gladly watched INSIDE MAN several times over the years, it's not simply highly entertaining with a stellar cast giving great performances, but even in the wake of my very first watch it struck me how well planned the entire robbery is, I genuinely think it could legit be pulled off in the real world perhaps more so than any other. Purposely storming a bank with lots of customers &amp; employees, making them all put on the same generic outerwear the heist team is, then later when you have smaller groups sequestered making sure each robber is definitely noticed by multiple hostages as ""one of them"" for alibis. Having it linger long as possible to allow for the construction in the supply room to hide the ring leader for an entire week.

Granted, as a far more popular mainstream film I could understand some tipping the hat to The Dark Knight, and yeah no doubt the Joker's bank heist at the start is pretty damn clever. I do think there's maybe a bit more suspension of disbelief needed for it to go exactly as it does (the one guy not noticing the bus in time to get nailed by it, for ex) but I feel like Joker's grand intentions sort of put it in a different category, he's not someone who's trying to pull it all off w/o the authorities or the bank hierarchy ever knowing who he is. And while yes Clive Owen's character in Inside Man winds up allowing Denzel's lead detective to have sort of more awareness of him than clearly he'd originally planned, Owen could have not done that and still fully successfully achieved what had been his master plan. But trust me this all isn't something I'm like super aggressively defensive of, I'd love to know what anyone else may think is the best movie heist plan to translate to reality. And it's not an 'all or nothing' thing in my mind, lots of movies can have multiple elements that would work, I just think Inside Man would have the highest percentage to do so.",movies,1613689729,CaptCoulson,True,1,64,2021-02-18

Why do I feel so worn out after watching a single 1 hour movie but can easily watch 10 or more episodes of a TV show straight (including 1 hour 30 min single episode shows)?,"I finally got around watching Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and boy am I so burned out. Which is ironic because I spent the whole day watching Book 2 of North and South while stuck with snow surrounding my house. Since each episode 1 and a half hours, that makes a total of almost 13 hours.

I breezed through all of Book 1 back on Sunday which is also 6 episodes of 1 hour 30 min each.

So it makes me curious why a single movie esp one as short as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes wear me out so easily? I could never finish an entire film series like The Matrix in one sitting because of how exhausted I get and have to spend one day per movie.

But i’m a younger age and honestly I was never that into the movie scene so I didn’t keep track of what was being produced and put out there nor do I remember.

I know that La La Land was one of the more recent films that had big expectations on it. Is that mainly because of how well Whiplash was received? I see LLL mentioned a lot when I try to find out about this topic.

Also, one film I do remember being super hyped up was The Force Awakens. I even saw that the first week it was out and the theatre was packed. Was Force Awakens at the same level of hype as say ... the prequels?

I see Avatar come up a lot too but to be honest I think I saw that one but couldn’t tell you anything about it.

Movies that overstay their welcome,"I watched Hobbs and Shaw tonight because I thought the trailer was amusing and even though I am definitely not a fan of the Fast and the Furious franchise, I thought the first hour of the movie worked pretty damn well. The action and look of everything was slick. The way Idris Elba's suit and motorcycle worked together was cool and the chemistry and humour between the Rock and Statham was pretty good as well. It had some funny writing. Not everything worked, but that first hour I was onboard for the ride. The 2nd hour started to grate on me a little though and about halfway in the helicopter scene I noticed, I had had enough. I think had it been 20/30 minutes shorter, I could have stuck with my enthusiasm but in the end it was a little too much of the same and a little too long of it.

"With the Well Deserved Acclaim of Wandavision, Let’s Revisit a Knights Tale","As we sit here over 20 years removed from a film that I know does actually get some actual recognition on this sub from time to time, I wanted to revisit A Knights Tale for our younger subscribers who may be seeing Paul Bettany flex his abilities for the first time. 

To start: Obviously going with the theme I have to start with Bettany here. His turn as Chaucer is absolutely masterful. To date it’s still my favorite role he’s had, and if you check this movie out I think I can bring you into my camp. His introductions are fantastic, his emotions are on full display, the man is a clinic. He was tragically underused in the Avengers films, but this should give you your fill. 

In addition: For those who only know Heath Ledger as the Joker, I seriously implore you to see this: As a straight man, he is still better looking than most women on this planet, and compared to 10 Things I Hate About You (also fantastic in its own right) Heath shows his chops and delivers a fantastic performance. 

You’ll also see a prime Alan Tudyk turn (thought he was British until I was an adult) and a solid addition from a young Robert Baratheon for you Game of Thrones fans. 

Shannyn Sossamon is also perfect in her role, and quite frankly awoken many things in me. 

I don’t want to spoil too much but Count Adhemar and Edward are also scene chewers.

There are those who get upset with the tone of the film: A Medieval Hero tale with modern rock. But keep in mind that A. It’s supposed to be Hammy and B. It’s actually accurate in the sense that jock rock jams would have totally been in place at these sporting events. 

I hope you’re all willing to give it a shot, because it’s a complete treasure",movies,1613547454,Lifesaboxofgardens,True,1,17,2021-02-16

American Animals- heist movie. What could they have done differently? SPOILERS,"The planning seemed really rushed. Here are things I would of done differently. 
1) I would of not thrown out a night robbery as quickly as they did. They could of attempted to stay in the library over night and hid from lockup. They could of attempted to jam or mess with the door to the private collection with something that would make it easy to open. 
2) They wasted time with the locks to the cases. They should of both brought crow bars. 
3) They didn’t plan on how to move these large heavy books. They should of had a dolly or moving square to transport them. 
4) They should of gone down to the basement at any time in the days leading up to the robbery and went out the emergency exit. 
5) They could of called the librarian in the private collection room and asked her to come outside to sign for some flowers - giving the guys 3-5 minutes to smash and grab. Longer if you can get a singing flower gram. 
6) That library had lots of places to hide things. After they had the books they could of looked for a hiding spot there instead of taking the books with them. That way they can go back at their leisure to retrieve them. 
7) After They have the books they should of waited years for the heat to die down. 5+ years later and in a different country. 
8) After 5+ years, search for a good backstory. Spend those 5 years becoming experts in those books so that you know every detail. 
9) Find a private collector - not an auction house.",movies,1613550383,Chris40004,True,1,1,2021-02-17

Does anyone have a good knowledge of the Batman animated movies?,"I've compiled [a long list](https://letterboxd.com/coentertainer/list/batmonth/) of films, but having seen less than half of them, I don't know how many of them heavily feature Batman, and how many of them just have him in a smaller supporting role. I'd love people's help in whittling down this list to just films that I'd consider ""Batman movies"".

My criteria is a little ill-defined in that regard. I'd consider the 2017 Justice League movie to be a ""Batman movie"", because there's no character in it that's so much the main character that they render Batman nothing more than a supporting character. By the same logic, I *wouldn't* consider The Lego Movie (2014) to be a ""Batman movie"" (as great a film as it is).

I realise there are probably loads that are in a grey area, but it would be good to hear from people which movies in the list just flat-out don't have much Batman. Likewise, if there's any I've left out, it would be great to hear about them.

As well as removing titles that don't qualify, I'd also like to hear which movies are particularly good or bad. I've seen most of the live-action movies, but only a smattering of the animated ones. My intention is to get this list down to just 31 titles, that people consider the best.",movies,1613554870,coentertainer,True,1,9,2021-02-17
I Can't Find My Favorite Childhood Movie,"I have been looking for a movie that I watched in my childhood but I can't find it. Maybe some experts here can help me with that. 

I apologize in advance if I don't give enough details, I will try to mention as many things as possible. I have a lot of vague memories so don't take what I say as 100% accurate. 

\- I don't remember exactly if it's an anime or not but it's not a real-life movie. So there is a possibility it's a cartoon or a 3D movie. I am pretty sure it was a movie because it was quite long(more than one hour) so I doubt it was one episode. 

\- I think the protagonist had long hair, a ponytail, or something like that. 

\- Throughout the movie, he will be defending/saving a female vampire. 

\- In the beginning, the setting is in a night city so there is a lot of noise, lights, and I think there was some sort of concert or music event. 

\- The protagonist fights against an enemy who has a giant monster(I don't think it was a robot but it was huge and it didn't seem to be a living being). I think the monster had a Chinese or Japanese character on it. 

\- At some point the protagonist is fighting around a train, at night, using his giant monster as well so you have like two titans fighting against each other(so they can probably fly as well).

\- Towards the end of the movie, the protagonist crosses a bridge in a sunny setting and the vampire tries to reveal itself a bit but gets burned so goes back to being hidden(in his umbrella). If I am not wrong, the umbrella was red or yellow. 

\- The female vampire has long black hair and I think she was older than him. 

\- The movie has a bit of a gore/horror setting(maybe like 20% of it?). 

\- Since I watched it when I was young, the movie was probably made before 2005 if not in the 20th century. 

I think this is it. I will be really grateful to anyone who knows which movie I am talking about.",movies,1613554934,Noursaidana,True,1,2,2021-02-17

"My opinion on ""God isn't dead""","My teacher forced my class to watch this movie some years ago. I never gave it much reflection, but now, I want to express how offensive and, more than that, stupid that whole thing is.

The movie is a propaganda, clearly. It might seem open-minded, since there's a debate between two sides (the atheist professor and the christian student), but that's just a facade. The debate is nothing more than a way to show the christian rethoric being superior, by making the professor use bad arguments that can be answered easily.

It all starts with Josh entering his university class. The first thing the professor does, without any regards, is commanding his students to write down ""god is dead"" because ""we won't be discussing this here"". What? I'm sorry, but I have never seen a professor doing something like that, especially because it's a philosophy class. There should be pretty much no subject out of the table. Of course, it serves to paint professors as arrogant and intolerant, which is sadly a common narrative for some religious groups. 

Josh refuses, and the professor pretty much gives him an ultimatum. Josh will either ""prove god exists or fail that class"". Josh completely ignores the fact that he could SUE THE PROFESSOR for hate speech and abuse of power. Instead, he buys into that little charade, this made up challenge. Who is the judge is Josh has won? The class of course. Not like most people are religious already, which would make this whole thing biased. Instead, it seems like pretty much all of Josh's classmates are atheists.

There are multiple side-stories here, which barely have any connection. Each one is more offensive than the other. In one of them, an atheist girl who is depicted as annoying gets cancer (probably as some kind of punishment) and her atheist bf dumps her. The dialogue is terrible, there is no emotion behind it, and it serves to portray a clear message to the viewers.

Let's not forget the hatred against other cultures. The chinese student wants to be a christian, but his father doesn't accept it. The muslim girl wants to be christian, but her muslim father doesn't accept it. The second case is a lot worse, because it shows islamism as being full of restrictions and violence. At the same time, it's funny how the movie never talks about what christianity prohibits, like gay sex or having a tatoo. It seems like, to be a christian, you just have to believe in god and talk about god. That's, of course, a way to attract new people without scaring them with the many restrictions.

It turns out the cancer girl just had to believe in god and in the second movie she gets cured. Which, of course, is offensive to people who pray intensely everyday and just die in the end. Her ex-bf is called out by his mother. She says that people who reject god may live good lives, because the devil uses his power to convert them to evil... Or something. Then there are the two pastors, coming up later.

Josh's arguments are really weak. At first, he says that the question about the creation of god can be simply answered with ""god has always existed"", which isn't really an answer. For some reason, the Universe needs a creator, but the God doesn't. The professor uses a Hawkings phrase to counter that claim, using appeal to authority, and then Josh comes back saying ""oh, Hawkings also dislikes philosophy, that means you can't quote him"". By that logic, you can't quote Plato, because he supported slavery. 

Then the arguments keep coming. Josh tries to make a connection between the ""let there be light"" with the Big Bang, despite the fact that, in the Bible, the Earth existed before light. There is just no way to make sense out of it. He says that, if there's no god, there's no morals. That's just a terrible thing to say. It sounds like christians's (in this movie) only reason to not kill are ""else I'm going to be punished"", which, of course, isn't how people should think.

Here comes the climax. Josh keeps asking why the professor hates God, and he admits he does. ""How do you hate something that doesn't exist?"". That one liner is the climax of this movie, and it comes straight out of a facebook page. Of course you can hate something that doesn't exist. Don't we hate characters all the time? Don't we hate concepts? Don't we hate ideas? Existing outside of our minds isn't needed for something to be loved our hated.

Then the professor dies. This sequence is terrible. He was never even a real atheist, just a christian who got mad at god because his mom died. That's, of course, how some christians view atheists: as brats who blame god for their misfortunes, and are just throwing a fit. Right before his death, the pastors come and what do they do?

A) Call am ambulance

B) Call the police

Of course, the answer is C, pressuring him into using his final moments to get converted. And that somehow is portrayed as a victory. ""Just a little pain, and then eternity in heaven"" sounds really dismissive and cold, even if you are sure there is a heaven. Getting hit by a car and bleeding to death isn't just a ""little"" pain. 

Then, in what almost seems like a party over the professor's death, the movie ends.

&amp;#x200B;

I get that a lot of my complaints have to do with my personal disbelief, but even if that wasn't the case, this movie is still terrible. Pretty much all actors are bad, lacking emotion. The dialogues are bland and sometimes cringy. A lot of time is wasted in side characters with no real impact, and the main conflict makes no sense at all. There could be a way to make a movie about a debate like that, but there's something it should remember or else it wouldn't work: be open. Debates are all about letting the viewer decide who presented the best arguments, not choosing it for them. And remember, this is a philosophy class, a debate like that is certain to happen anyways.",movies,1613586500,stamine,True,1,50,2021-02-17

"What is it called when the ""air gets sucked out of the room"" in a movie? If there's not a name for it, let know your favorite scene that follows this description.","By that I mean scenes where the intensity builds and builds and then all of a sudden everything stops, nothing happens for a second, and then all hell breaks loose. I described it as the ""air being sucked out of the room"" because it's usually occopanied by a ""suck-in"" sound effect and because it's kind of a ""hold your breath"" moment. I really like this bit of sound design but I don't know what it's called. I'm sure theres a name for it but I don't know it. The elevator scene from ""Cabin in the Woods"" is similar to what I'm describing. A soldier says something along the lines of ""Oh no."" then theres silence, the elevator goes *ding* and the sh*t hits the fan. Apparently it's using something the ear's acoustic reflex, where they make your inner ear relax, via a second or 2 of silence, so that when the moment actually happens it sounds louder and more exciting than it would otherwise.",movies,1613586907,Big1ronOnHisHip,True,1,34,2021-02-17

A Map of Tiny Perfect Things ( 2021 ),"A very cutesy tale of two teenagers set up in a time loop. With stunning scenery along with characters you actually root for, it makes up for a light hearted feel good movie. Albeit it starts off slow, it packs an emotional punch and manages to put a smile on your face multiple times. The two main characters work very well together. And no this movie is not a copy of Palm Springs.

Some films have one really huge twist that changes the entire story, while others have a lot of smaller ones. 

It's the second kind that I'm looking for. 

What jumps to my mind first is ""charade"", the 1963 film. The whole film is built around the idea that you can't truly trust what someone else tells you, and that you don't know where the truty stops, and the lies begin.

There is probably about 20 twists in total, it's just non stop shifting.

There has never been a genuinely good horror movie. It's simply not possible to illicit fear with cinema,"The entire goal of a comedy is to make the audience laugh. As such, if the audience doesn't laugh, it is by definition a bad comedy. Likewise, the purpose of a horror movie is to illicit fear in the audience. The simple fact of the matter is that horror movies aren't scary. No matter what, you know you are just watching a fictional movie, thus you are not experiencing fear. The only horror movies that are actually watchable are the ones that are more comedy than they are horror, and those work because of the comedy. 

On top of not being scary, horror movies are always predictable and lacking in any storyline. It's always the same thing where you have some sort of big bad scary monster or ghost or psycho killer, and the big bad kills all the expendable good guys until the main character is the last person standing. It's the same formula over and over",movies,1613344493,Ornery_Captain,True,1,3,2021-02-14

"The MCU makes better movies than Scorsese. If you're going to make theme park movies, at least do it right","Martin Scorsese famously declared that Marvel movies aren't cinema, that they are closer to theme park rides. While this is certainly true, it is also true of Scorsese's movies. They are more theme park rides than actual cinema. The only difference is that one is superhero themed and the other is Italian New Yorker or mafia themed. In either case they are making movies that are meant as pure entertainment, rather than art. 

 Take Goodfellas, Casino, The Departed, Wolf of Wall Street, Gangs of New York and strip all the pretentiousness and you're left with movies that are essentially just The Avengers with Italians. Taxi Driver meanwhile is basically the same thing as a comic book movie. Just add some Joker makeup and boom you have an origin story. Meanwhile Raging Bull is just a worse version of Logan without any interesting set pieces. 

The issue with Scorsese movies compared to Marvel movies is that they are too slow. To make an analogy, Marvel movies are like the big feature roller coaster than breaks speed records, and Scorsese movies are like the tiny little cruisers only going 30 km/h. 

Compare that MCU movies you have far superior CGI and special effects, better and more fit actors, far superior de-aging tech, better stunt work, more excitement and action. Superior in every way.",movies,1613345406,Ornery_Captain,True,1,33,2021-02-14

To All the Boys: Always and Forever,"The main conflict of this movie is that Lara Jean has an escapist fantasy of going to a rich kid school because she visited Washington Square Park the one week in the spring that it's nice out. I say this as a New Yorker.

I am glad she pursued her own preferences but I did wish the break up had stuck to be more realistic (although the way Peter did it was a bit cruel, even if we're to believe he was acting out of trauma). If there's one thing this serious has gotten right, it's capturing the quirks and motivations of teenagers, sometimes to a fault.

I was pleasantly charmed by the acting. Maybe I shouldn't have been, considering the success of the first movie was thanks in part to the leads' chemistry. I really appreciated the care that clearly went into the costuming, especially with the three sisters. Also, goddamn am I attracted to John Corbett, especially when he's dad-ing.

Imogen Poot's Performance in Vivarium is really good,"Spoiler Warning:

I hadn't seen her in anything before this, but her performance was the best part of the movie to me.  
 I was definitely predisposed to relate with Jesse Eisenberg's character a lot more, and I think he did a decent job, but Poot's acting was so much more moving. Eisenberg makes it seem like another Black Mirror episode, but her range in scenes like caring for the kid (Martin 2) , being terrified by him, the way she tried to help Eisenburg's character, the way she plays with the kid while also being deeply disturbed by it.  -- all incredible. ESPECIALLY the scene where Eisenburg's character dies and she is crying over him, and then Martin 2 brings the box with the body bag and she is doing this absolutely gut-wrenching moaning and crying while making the most hurt and disturbed face I've seen in maybe any movie. Just damn, it gave me chills, and I didn't even really care about Eisenburg's character!   
I just haven't really heard many people talking about her in this movie or that scene, even though I think her character's perspective is by far the most interesting part of the movie, and Poots really elevates it.",movies,1613351801,in-dog-years-im-dead,True,1,34,2021-02-14

Speed racer (2018),"Now I know this movie gets some shit, but imo I think it’s really good! 

It is a extremely satisfying plain out, “ good guy bad guy “ dance off, and I belive that it plays off beautifully, I’ll list my personal pros and cons!

Pros:

- the soundtrack ( thunderhead one is ESPECIALLY AMAZING )

- story: again I think it’s pretty starightforward and solid ( it’s a movie for kids it has to be simple it doesn’t need to be a kubrik mindf*ck)

- racing scenes: just like speed racer says, when he gets behind the wheel everything just makes sense, you honestly forget about what the fuck is going on and just admire in awe, even if the cgi is pretty bad haha.

- the last race : in just one word, ELECTRIFYING. This scene is honestly just amazing it has me on the edge of my seat all the time, how he masterfully overtakes everyone even after getting blocked at the started, he reaches cannonball and out drives him so hard he breaks down and is forced to use the hook. But again, speed uses this against him, shows it to everyone and only solidifying him at the place in everyone’s heart. Now I can’t put into words just how breathtaking the second part of the last race just is, you’ll have to watch it by yourself if you want to. 

Cons:

Cgi: it’s bad, hahahah! Although in my opinion the cars are relatively good ( although that just might me my child bias speaking ) the background is almost unforgivable.

Acting: obviously, but people don’t watch this movie to see DiCaprio, they do it for the same thing they watch John wick, they’re enjoyable movies!

Sphere (1998),"Sphere is a movie adaptation from a novel written by Michael Crichton, and it was directed by Barry Levinson, and released in 1998. Barry Levinson is the guy behind Good Morning Vietnam and Rain Man (two wonderful movies). But this movie was a deception. (I haven't red the book yet by the way.)

Soooo... Really this movie had a lot of potential, great actors, a good budget (≈80 millions $) a really intresting plot, and to be fair a nice set (a but cheap compared to the Abyss but still does the job).
But man it was a pain watching it really, every shot just feels freaking off! Whether it's the composition or just the timing in the editing, something is off all the time. The lighting isn't that great but it's okay. Really the camera work just ruines it all sadly. And the interaction between everyone also feels sooo off its frustrating! Cause yes their was so much potential in this movie. And I actually feel like it was meant to be a lot longer, like it was cut down or something cause everything seems ruched. You don't feel the tention coming in and you actually stick to the end just for the sake of knowing... It's sad to see it wasted like that.
Remembering what Levinson actually worked, makes me understand that, it's not his playground. Rain Man and Good Morning Vietnam are far far away from what Sphere is supposed to be. And I think his just not good at climax movies like that (slash horror a bit). And I think he actually tried to hard to make it look anxious. But unfortunately, I think that what makes a movie anxious isn't weird camera angle and everything, but more of steady and fix shot, where to tension gently rises. It's hard explain it with words, and would be better of just showing things, but I can't so I'll refer the movies like The Thing from Jhon Carpenter or Alien etc...
I mean like seriously, to anyone making cinema out there, keep it simple. But here is the best part of it. Keeping something simple doesn't mean making it less imaginative, ho no! It's the opposite! Making something simple requires a lot more thinking, cause you need to convey more emotion through less. Like in animation where subtle movements usually sales more the emotion than something complicated.

I'm getting away from the subject, but just wanted to remind this to anyone who would actually bother reading this (thank you if got there by the way) but it's a serious advice that I'm giving here, cause I ""work"" a bit on 3D animation and everything. And I often see little movies done in 3D, and they visually look really great, but the camera composition nearly always ruines it, and it's sad to see this, and I think it's the same issue here... Except that it was an 80 million $ movie with highly qualified professionals. But hey, everyone can make mistakes, the thing is to learn from them.

Ho also by the way, for some reason the soundtrack of the movie sticked with me. It felt like I had already heard it a couple of times even though this is clearly my first time seeing this movie.

Anyway, it's worth having a look at it just if you're curious and all, but don't expect nothing from it (except the music 🤷‍♂️).

Does re-watching some movies in the elder age makes you think quite the opposite about heroes too? (The Prestige discussion),"First post here, sorry if wrong subreddit.

Just re-watched The Prestige in my 20s, and the first time I watched this movie I was eleven. I've been always thinking that Angier was a hero and Borden (the guy who tied the sailor knot and killed Angier's wife) was a villain. Now I just watch again and it makes me think quite the opposite.

Borden made a simple mistake due to his ambitions, it happens to almost everyone. But it costed life. Instead of hiding his guilt, he faced it and came to the funeral to tell that he's sorry. Yes, it couldn't turn wife back to life again, but there ain't much options. He did what he could do. And faced the answer with dignity.

And the fact that he lied about what knot he tied is debatable: he experienced so much stress, that his own brain could easily hijack his memory, so he could be telling the truth, that he didn't remember.

Angier, on the other side, sacrificed the rest of his life to pursuing and ruining his rival's one. Borden (at least one of them, as there were two) was trying to live a happy life with his family and a brother. Angier was avenging and ruining him piece by piece, with envy and evil in heart, destroying himself and his rival's existence. Why would he want to kill him in the first place with a gun? Would that help to bring his wife back to life? I think the real villain was the protagonist.

Either the movie's plot was written with lots of holes that novel doesn't have (I didn't read one, just on my way to buy it though), or it's just the amateur classic logic of ""devote my whole life to avenge"", which maybe in the movies looks impressive, but in real life it just destroys the person who takes that path.

\---

But after I completed the movie (I was halfway through when was writing it), I just see that Borden has done a miserable thing by just killing his opponent in the end... Didn't remember it in the first place.

"Scorsese has an unmatched filmography, but he's never made a true masterpiece","In terms of total filmography, no other filmmaker can really come close to what Scorsese has done. Over the course of 5 decades he has continuously made great movie after great movie, and has continued to evolve as a filmmaker and keep things fresh. However, throughout his entire career he's never reached the pinnacle of filmmaking by making a true masterpiece.

Yes he has a lot of incredible movies like Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Last Temptation of Christ, Age of Innocence, but these films just don't quite reach the highest level of filmmaking. None of his movies are great technical achievements like Citizen Kane or 2001 A Space Odyssey. None of his movies are 100% perfectionist like some of Kubrick or Fincher's work. His only movie that really tapped into the cultural zeitgeist of its era and became iconic thematically was Taxi Driver, but there are plenty of movies that have done a much stronger job at this (e.g. Network, Do The Right Thing). Scorsese is an amazing storyteller and his movies are almost always entertaining and extremely well directed, but he just doesn't have that next level creative vision.",movies,1613171326,Ornery_Captain,True,1,106,2021-02-12

Jerry Maguire 2 Story Details Revealed By Cameron Crowe,"Filmmaker Cameron Crowe recently revealed details on his story idea for a Jerry Maguire sequel.

The 1996 film was perhaps Crowe’s biggest hit.

Crowe made other American romantic-comedy and drama staples like Say Anything and Almost Famous.

Crowe said he has always thought Jerry Maguire 2 would be about Rod Tidwell, played by Cubs Gooding, Jr. and his wife Marcee.

Regina King, from HBO’s Watchmen, played Marcee Tidwell in the movie.

Crowe also said that Say Anything is the film he would make a sequel for before any others.

Though Crowe says it is unlikely, stay tuned for any future announcements of a Jerry Maguire 2.

Movies similar to,"Can someone recommend me movies similar to John Wick or Willy’s wonderland? I want something that is an action movie but silly at the same time. I do want it to have an interesting story though. Actors don’t have to be the ones from those movies but hopefully the acting is good. I’ll post the synopsis for the two movies down below. Ty in advance!!


Willy’s wonderland 
When his car breaks down, a quiet loner agrees to clean an abandoned family fun center in exchange for repairs. He soon finds himself waging war against possessed animatronic mascots while trapped inside Willy's Wonderland.



John wick

John Wick is an American neo-noir action-thriller media franchise created by screenwriter Derek Kolstad and owned by Summit Entertainment. Keanu Reeves plays John Wick, a retired hitman seeking vengeance for the killing of the dog given to him by his recently deceased wife, and for stealing his car.",movies,1613175532,BabyChubbs2019,True,1,43,2021-02-12

THE LAST JEDI deserves better," I could write a 100 page essay on why and how this is the best star wars movie to date, and as long as writers don't dare to challenge their viewers out of fear from hateful toxic fans that think any movie without fast pace, flashy, overchoreographed dance numbers that are the prequel fights. TLJ challenges the viewer. it challenges what they think, and what they thought they knew about their characters and star wars as a whole. it provides new lore for us and corrects the misconceptions of star wars whilst also gives a reality check to this franchise of space wizards.

it contains some of the juiciest character development we have ever seen for all our characters. just like TLJ challenged us, it also challenges our characters to rethink what they know, break down their walls and gain a new insight. Finn, a first order grunt, breed to fight, has a narrow black and white view on the world and doesn't know how everything works. this is highlighted when they arrive on canto bight. finn is amazed by the beauty and wonder that sits above the corruption and greed of its golden exterior. when looking over the race track, rose tells finn ""look closer"", and we see the riders shocking their rides, the workers striking their child slaves. i'll take about rose more later but she served as a torch to finn to teach him why the resistance fights. then on the battle of crait, finn is ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, since he fears the FO and will do whatever means necessary to destroy them. this was his final learning point. he was thinking like a stormtrooper, and didn't realise that he wasn't going to make it. his ship was burning up and losing speed. rose saved him and teaches him that's not how they'll win this war. to quote her ""that's how we'll win, not fighting what we hate, saving what we love"". this is my favourite quote in star wars. rose taught finn we won't win this war by blindly throwing down our lives but we'll win by staying alive and save those along the way.

the second character i'll talk about is poe. at the start of the movie he is an impulsive, immature pilot who only sees the battle. he lays down the lives of the resistances entire fleet of bombers, just to achieve the goal. leia is poe's development for this movie, and by the end of TROS, poe reflects leia. leia teaches poe what it means to lead. and to take a note from roses book, we don't win by killing what we hate, saving what we love. this lesson echos throughout TLJ.

onto luke, he is a perfect character in this movie. stays with the films theme of failure. luke failed our expectations, intentionally. everyone expected legendary hero luke skywalker. brave jedi and war hero, the symbol of everlasting hope. but that wasn't luke. luke is human. and TLJ teaches us that. the luke we saw and expected wasn't who luke himself was. the galaxy didn't know he was son of vader. the galaxy never knew luke almost fell to the dark. to them he was a perfect man, void of flaws. luke experienced imposter syndrome. he couldn't live up to the galaxies expectations. and when he failed to raise a new generation of jedi, those flaws were shown to the galaxy. he failed them. he failed leia. he failed the parents of the children he took. and he couldn't face them. he had to leave. he wallowed in his depression and self hatred for years. he was humanised by RJ and then goes and pulls of the largest canon force feat we have ever seen. 10/10 character.

rey nobody. she tells the audience that it doesn't matter who you are. you don't have to be a skywalker to be powerful. anyone can. (JJ ruined this for me in TROS but still). you don't have to be from a legendary legacy to wield the force. if a nobody from jakku can achieve greatness, anyone can. rey is an inspiration in this movie. no matter your past, you can be great.

rose. this is unpopular but i love rose. her past, values, and lessons to finn reflect the very thing that a resistance is and what it means to rebel. her past of oppression, pain and loss are things that unify people, and spark rebellions. her lessons to finn directly reflects the values of the rebellion. she is the personification of rebellion.

the theme of failure is prevelant in this movie. masters fail their apprentice and vice versa. finn and rose fail the resistance by not saving them in time, and directly resulted in leading the first order to crait, where they were almost wiped out. poe kills all the resistance bombers. rey fails to make luke return and reignite his faith in the jedi.

cinematography. this movie is beautiful. the battle of crait. ahch-to. the hyperspace scene. the throne room. the most beautiful star wars movie.

the contrast (or lack of) between good and bad, light and dark. highlighted by DJ, the splicer finn and rose met on canto bight, he shows in war that there is good on the bad side, and bad on the good side. each side is just fighting for what they think is right. and in there are no winners on each side. the real winners are the arms dealers, the corrupt politicians and those who didn't take part. ""live free, don't join""

a common criticism i see is this movie is a copy of all the other movies. in reality, they mistake plagiarism for intertextuality. this is the first movie to directly reference all the other movies and tied them together. we see the effects of people's actions and the echos of the past.

kylo ren, in my opinion, is the best written character in star wars. his story is tragic and deep. as a child he had both the light and dark trying to claim him. two masters trying to turn him. this goes with the theme of good and bad, and after the throne room fight, kylo realised this, and offered to start fresh, let the past die and rebuild the galaxy. snoke was constantly pulling him to the dark. luke was pulling him to the light. it tore is soul apart, splitting him to the bone. his character is beautiful. he is a more relatable character than vader. i feel bad for him because with vader it's hard to relate or sympathise with a character who murdered kids out of spite.

i wrote all this whilst on the toilet, i hope you enjoyed it",movies,1613175811,-grogu-,True,1,31,2021-02-12

Shawshank isn't that great of a movie and I'm really glad that it didn't win best picture or other oscars,"Maybe it could have won one or two! The problem with the movie is it kind of falls into a series of little stories or tasks that the protagonist overcomes. First Andy makes friends with everyone/acclimates, then he has to deal with the sisters (and they get written out), then he starts sending letters and doing taxes for others, then the Brooks story comes in, etc. - each one is a bit too independent from the others in my opinion, they don't really compliment one another enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

The movie is beloved because it shows so much of what is possible in life and basically a blueprint of how to live life the best you can but a piece of artwork should not be purely pedagogical. Forrest Gump on the other hand is a much more excellent movie. I really enjoy Shawshank and would give it 4/4 stars but I don't think it's better than Forrest Gump.

The Academy Award for 'Best Original Song' is a bad category and it needs to be fixed with one simple change.,"The official eligibility rules for the category read: *an original song consists of words and music, both of which are original and written specifically for the motion picture. There must be a clearly audible, intelligible, substantive rendition (not necessarily visually presented) of both lyric and melody, used in the body of the motion picture or as the first music cue in the end credits.*

The flaw here is that credits music is allowed. In my humble opinion, the rule should be changed to require the song to be used within the body of the film. I feel like it's too easy to tack on a song that has zero use within a film and have it play over the end credits, just to snag a nomination. Reward films that weave music into their narrative, not just ones that plug and play after the story ends.",movies,1613179873,TheUnknownStitcher,True,1,12,2021-02-12

I think this year has just had a much more diverse roster of award-worthy films, whereas last year there were only a few films that were far out in the lead.

I very much liked last year that a smaller film one, but this year I feel Netflix are just gonna dominate the awards with Mank, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom and Da 5 Bloods, and also Nomadland is out on Hulu soon.

What do you think is Gene Wilder’s best performance?,"I went on a bit of a binge today with older films. Started out with Willy Wonka, then Blazing Saddles &amp; finally Young Frankenstein.

Willy Wonka is actually an interesting one for me because I always grew up on the Johnny Depp remake (which I actually am quite fond of). But Gene Wilder’s take on the character is just miles better than anything from the 2000s version. I’ve never seen a character portray such childlike wonder &amp; imagination like that. 

I know his role in Blazing Saddles is sort of supportive but that scene in the jailhouse where he’s reminiscing about his outlaw past while drowning himself in whiskey is such a greatly acted situation.

The Motive [2017] Spanish film about a writer who begins to manipulate the lives of those around him,"I just watched this on Netflix (UK) and I couldn’t find anywhere to discuss it so here we are.

It starts off quite slow with Lost In Translation mixed with The Lobster vibes. I thought things would really ramp up once we got to the apartment complex but it kind of dribbled on until it got to the twist and then WHABAM it wrapped up in about 5 minutes. It was too slow for me. Calibre is a great example of a slow slow burn with tension. This movie lacked tension and so many moments were like we were in stuck in purgatory until the next scene.

By the way I was not expecting a karaoke scene that long and intense.

And while I get that the (gratuitous) nude scenes are meant to emphasize everybody’s mediocrity, I really didn’t feel like we needed quite so many of them.

I think the movie would have benefited from more characters (like different neighbors in the complex) which would have allowed some more funny moments. Although this is not a haha movie, this is a gently snort through your nose with a furrowed brow movie. Also a bit more light would have helped, I felt like every scene was so dark. And that twist! I love a movie that makes you want to rewatch it with hindsight goggles.

So I suppose that Alvaro did use the super until he found someone he liked better (the Mexican lady)? But he was so in love with her at karaoke and then was icy to her a few scenes later - is this betraying how cold he really is inside? Was the wife sleeping with the teacher?

Disney's 'Dinosaurs' (2000) had some great Horror elements to it.,"First off the big baddie who plays Kron plays Sebastian in The Little Mermaid, let that sink in lol. 

The first scene takes off as a fantastic horror set up, when the small duck-billed dinosaur stumbles upon the Carnotaur hunting the heard. Then the apocalyptic scene of the meteorite slamming into the earth, causing a tsunami that destroys their island within seconds. Following the Carnotaur's who essentially act like Jason Voorhees the entire film, slowly hunting and picking off the heard. Although yes, this is a family friendly film, focused on an audience of children (me being one of them, was 9 when I saw it in theaters). It has some fantastically terrifying scenes, locations are great, and the cgi holds up fairly well for being over twenty years old. The monkeys you can see the cgi is a little dated. Plus you can't have a Disney film without a forced romance, lol. Curious if anyone remembers the ride at Disney World that was used to promote this film, was a blast when I rode it.",movies,1612998452,bigblueberryboobies,True,4,22,2021-02-10

Why has no one as a joke or as a work of art ever released a film to basically troll the viewer.,"Film if you think about it is very predictible, superhero films you pretty much know how it will play out.

Good guy gets new powerful enemy. Enemy gets advantage at middle of film. Good guy looks beat. Good guy comes back at end.

When i say trolling i dont mean that the good guy loses at the end. Im talking more extreme than that.

Say for example avengers endgame. (Im not saying this script would be a good example of trolling but just to highlight what i mean)

So all avengers movies lead up to endgame everyone is expecting some mega film with huge fighting scenes.

But what if there was none of that and instead it just focused on say Thor sitting in a room half the film asking for billions in cash before he will fight thanos

You have over an hour of boring in room discussion about pay negotiating  finally they agree to give him money and he shows up and kills thanos in 2 seconds. Its not even a fight.

I know it would be a shit film. I know everyone would go mad and hate it. But would no one else love to see the fallout from something like that?

Even if it was for a week and they jad the real endgame film ready for release. Id love to see film just do something so different like that

Where there just messing with the audience to such a degree. 

I think its the type of thing that would give a franchise  a legendary status for doing something different. Like when T mobile did the flashmon ads.",movies,1612999989,mushmushmush,True,0,56,2021-02-10

"A Wizard of Oz remake has potential, but what tone will it have?","Like a lot of people, I shook my head when I heard that [a Wizard of Oz remake was in the works.](https://variety.com/2021/film/news/wonderful-wizard-of-oz-remake-1234904194/) What's next? A remake of Citizen Kane and Casablanca? However, the more I thought about it, the more interested I became. I think a remake (or another adaptation of the Oz books) has potential, but will New Line actually go down the route I talk about? 

Now I will admit I haven't read any of L. Frank Baum's Oz books but I do hear they get pretty dark. This is why some people call 1985's Return to Oz more faithful to the source material than the 1939 version. You have a woman with [removable heads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBfmR4rEeHU), [a desert that will kill you with one touch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErM4NvO6Ezg), and those [creepy wheelers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM0RFE3QGAU). At the time, Return to Oz was seen as being too dark and it flopped at the box office. It has since developed a cult following. 

Even though I think New Line isn't going to go really dark with this movie; probably to keep it more in line with the original, I think going darker route would be very interesting. Just think of the visuals and costume design that are possible. I just hope it isn't a shameless retread of the original with bad CGI. Maybe a combination of the styles found in Return to Oz and Oz the Great and Powerful? 

I have faith in Nicole Kassell, but I'll remain skeptical until we get more information.",movies,1613000731,ggroover97,True,0,28,2021-02-10

"If I was an actor, doing ADR would be such a weird thing to do","For all who might nit do, ADR (**A**utomated **D**ialogue **R**eplacement) is a Post-Production process, where actors sit in a voice booth, and re-record any lines of dialogue that might need to be redone in a clearer, or better way.

Maybe certain lines weren’t heard clearly enough because of excess noise on the set (weather machines, wind, the mic not picking it up), or if the director just isn’t pleased with the delivers, and wants it done in a better way, performance-wise. It's one of those elements of filmmaking that doesn't seem to be brought up/talked about much.
__________________________________________________________________

Whatever the reason is, ADR is in integral part of making sure all the character’s lines/dialogue is heard clearly &amp; convincingly by the audience, but personally speaking, if I were an actor, I’d find it to be a really *weird* process.

Sitting in a recording booth, and watching playback of my performance, saying the lines again, and making sure it syncs up perfectly with my mouth’s movements, like Dubbing an Anime, I would feels so awkward doing it. Anyone else think so?",movies,1613001527,J-Bradley1,True,0,26,2021-02-10

Currently just looking for an illustration to highlight that sometimes we think we understand something, but miss the point entirely.

Looking for a movie scene where:

- a concept was explained and someone just gave a very confused face
- or a scene where we as the viewer clearly see what’s going on but a character is completely oblivious?

The wild bunch (Spoilers),"Last night I finally got round to watching the wild bunch and, tbh, I'm furious at myself for not doing it sooner. It has to be noted down among the very greatest westerns. Excellent story, believable characters, brutal as hell and a finale that doesn't get talked about nearly enough. A masterpiece. 

There are 2 points of note though (hence the spoiler tag)

1. I was almost in tears in the final battle when Pike fell. Not just because he's suddenly one of my favourite movie characters ever, but by the way Dutch cries out his name and rushes to help him, even though he's already gone, only for Dutch to die too.

And

2. Robert Ryan as Thornton pursuing the bunch throughout the story felt like a wet blanket. As if he was barely trying and, that if he were to catch them it'd be dumb luck. But, once the credits rolled it dawned on me that he didn't *want* to catch them. They were still, in truth, his brothers in arms and under the circumstances of his capture, if the roles were reversed, he likely would have done the exact same thing.",movies,1613005056,Philcycles84,True,2,24,2021-02-10

I love Valkyrie (2008),"I usually don't like WW2 movies, but this is an exception. A Tom Cruise starred WW2 movie, I expect Cruise to be a charismatic and heroic American soldier fighting the Germans. But Cruise played a more subdued role of a German plotting to assassinate Hitler. I'm quite surprised with his nuanced performance because I had always associate Cruise to be an overactor, boy was I wrong. 

It is one of the best paced movie I've watched which lends itself to a great suspenseful thriller. Even if you knew the outcome it is still gripping throughout. And I never thought to be as emotional as I did at the end of the movie, mostly thanks to its sorrowful soundtrack (kinda reminiscent of John William's work on Schindler's List). 

I also like the cold portrayal of Hitler in this movie. He's more frightening than ever which builds more the suspense and the desperation to assassinate this guy. Everyone in the cast was amazing. Particularly Tom Wilkinson and Kenneth Branagh. And I didn't even know Eddie Izzard is a comedian when I watched this, he was stellar in the movie.

As someone not too aware of fascinating historical story like this, I'm glad they made a kickass movie out of it.

I FoRgOt a Movie Title,The setting I believe is in the South in the 1920s or 30s. It has a storyline where there is a prostitute who was stolen from her home. The people who stole her got her hooked on heroin. After she was rescued they brought her back to her town where she became a revival preacher and she would show her heroin scars. She wore a white dress. (I remember her being a newspaper). I believe the story was written from a male main characters point of view. Either the dad commits suicide at the end or is killed. I think she had a controlling father. Honestly I’m not sure if it was a movie or tv episode.,movies,1612824217,GnikSselb,True,1,2,2021-02-08
Arrival has become unwatchable for me. (SPOILERS),"Recently, I decided to reward Arrival on 4K as doing so since the first time since theatres. Upon rewatching, I liked almost all of it. I thought it was a very intelligent and mature movie for its kind, and had deep ideas and everything. That is until the end, where it is revealed that she’s been having flash forwards, which I thought was a great twist, but she still chose to have the child? Anyone find this a bit problematic. Like she’s choosing to have a child that she knows will suffer and die at a young age, but does it to fulfill her motherhood? Or something? The whole thing for me was just sad. I usually prefer darker endings to the more light hearted ones, like Chinatown and Night of the Living Dead. But seriously this has become unwatchable to me at this point. It just kinda makes me sad and not really like the character at this point. Idk perhaps some thoughts from you guys?",movies,1612824221,the-microbe,True,1,19,2021-02-08

There Will Be Blood is the greatest film of the 21st Century,"There Will Be Blood is the definitive film of the 21st century. It has everything that a modern film should have. I'm going to dive deep down to explain why TWBB is the greatest film of the 21st century.

The performances are incredible from start to finish. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the performance of a lifetime as Daniel Plainview, a 19th century silver miner turned to oil prospector. He immerses his character into someone who has the traits of greed, insanity, and vengeance. Others around him like Paul Dano are great as well as the objects that get in Plainview's way.

The story serves as a slow moving look at capitalism and insanity. As the film progresses, the madness trapped inside of Daniel Plainview being to grow and later break out in the end about the monologue about The Third Revelation. The theme of capitalism feels more relevant today then it was in 2007. It's a decade spanning journey about what happens when a socipath who gains more power.

The cinematography is very brilliant. Robert Elswitt manages to create distinctive visuals that are impressive and haunting. This is most evident in the oil burning scene where he turns the sequence into essential art. The score is brilliantly experimental with it's sombering violins fitting in well during every scene.

Overrall the film is what Paul Thomas Anderson should be noted for along with The Master, Boogie Nights, and Phantom Thread.",movies,1612824460,randomspawner,True,1,6,2021-02-08

So for a few years now, I've had this scene in my head, but I simply cannot remember which movie it is from. I would really appreciate it if one of you could help me out.

So the scene goes as following: dude faints in a sauna/spa due to receiving shocking news, two guys come to his aid, one of them is african-america and kneels next to his head, other dude is a ginger and kneels next to his feet. They are all naked, so for obvious reason, he tries to get them to switch places before they carry him out.

Tremors is the best Monster film ever!,"OK maybe it’s Jaws but I have yet to ever see a monster film beat the quality of either of them. They both did good with such a small budget because they really understood how not showing the monster a lot benefited and when they do they cause the most damage and it’s shocking. Plus they both had a great cast that when the monsters aren’t attacking the people are actually fun to hang out with. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward. Two normal looking guys who just had great chemistry. Or the 3 guys from Jaws. Peter Jackson’s King Kong, Deep Blue Sea, Aliens, Jurassic Park and Pacific Rim were also pretty good, but Godzilla: King of the Monsters and The Meg really could take a cue or two from these. The casts was made of some talented actors but didn’t give them only thing fun to say or do, the monsters looked cool but just kinda show up and thrash around a little, and when In Godzilla they fight you could hardly see anything!",movies,1612826234,seveer37,True,1,116,2021-02-08

And the xenomorph itself is one of the best movie monsters of all time, the sexual organs make it look like a truly nightmarish creature, and the very idea of it is just disturbing, a creature that pretty much rapes and impregnates you with an alien, which then forces its way out of your stomach, and the chestburster scene is one of the most iconic scenes in cinema, HR Geiger really made something nightmarish and creepy.

The French Connection ending? [SPOILERS],"- Is it is implied in the end that Popeye shot Mulderig (the cop who hates him) on purpose? Alternatively, is Popeye supposed to be a bit of an Ahab figure, so caught up in the pursuit that he's lost his humanity? He doesn't flinch after Mulderig dies and was also very reckless in the famous chase scene, endangering innocent lives. 

- Do you think this movie is against the ""war on drugs"", or am I reading too much into it? They make these cops out to be heroes for the most part, but ""Frog #1"" escapes in the end and the other conspirators mostly suffer minor consequences. It sort of implies that all that effort and energy was a waste of time, which is a pretty progressive view on the drug war in 1971 (not so much today).",movies,1612827186,Charlie_Wax,True,1,1,2021-02-08

Essential grunge-era movies?,"Lately I've been on a nostalgia kick. The early 90s grunge period appeals to me for a few reasons: it was a brief moment in time when counter-culture was mainstream before the wave of commercial rap and boy bands consumed the zeitgeist in the late 90s. It was also the end of the analog age, the time period right before the Internet hit. These movies have a certain quaint, intimate feel because of that isolation. The sense of time and place is very specific. 

Is it possible to come up with a list of movies that capture the feel of this time period? Here's what I've watched so far that seems fitting:

Slacker (1990)

My Own Private Idaho (1991)

Singles (1992)

Clerks (1994)

Reality Bites (1994)

Kicking and Screaming (1995) 

Empire Records (1995)

Tenet is a mess,"Tenet has defeated The Dark Knight Rises in the race for the worst film Christopher Nolan has made. Nolan was on a two-time streak with Interstellar and Dunkirk, but it all crashes down thanks to Tenet. It could've been great with Nolan and a couple of competent actors and like the plot being similar to Inception but it comes down to it's execution. There's a good film hiding in Tenet somewhere but it gets fucked over by mediocre acting, poorly written characters, OBNOXIOUS SOUND, and a lot of questionable decisions overrall. So let's see why Tenet is a jumbled mess.

The film has an interesting premise. An agent is given a single word as a weapon, which happens to be the titular title of the film. He uses the word to prevent World War III and must travel through time and bend the laws of nature. The agent happens to be called The Protagonist. I guess Nolan named the lead that name because Fight Club had The Narrator as the lead. 

The performances are surprisingly mediocre except for Robert Pattinson. John David Washington is very dull as The Protagonist. He can't even bring life to his otherwise flat character and the way he delivers his lines are awkward and emotionless. The other actors are simply forgettable and are used as pointless side characters.

The screenplay is very bad and is proof that Nolan doesn't know how to write a character. He has interesting ideas for Tenet but can't figure out how to develop his characters or even sympathize with them. The screenplay is also responsible for the amount of plot holes in the film. Such as why did The Protagonist give a shit about this random woman and her kid? He was a steel cold CIA killer.

The sound mixing was atrocious. I know that some of Nolan's films have bad sound mixing but Tenet made me realize how awful he is with the sound process. The sound mixing in Tenet literally raped my ears. Everything was obnoxiously loud that I couldn't even hear the dialogue. The fact that this could get nominated for Best Sound at the Oscars and BAFTAS is highly laughable.

I will admit that the music is the saving grace of Nolan's undercooked and messy extravaganza. Ludwig Goransson is a talented composer. His work on Black Panther is great and the score for Tenet is so good that it puffs up the soulless and dull story of the film.",movies,1612834967,randomspawner,True,1,10,2021-02-08

How is Armond White still on Rotten Tomatoes?!,"This man hasn't put out a single positive review for any of the acclaimed movies of 2020. The only one that comes close is *On the Rocks*. Same goes for 2019, his only good reviews were for *Ford v. Ferrari* and *Once Upon a Time in Hollywood*. However, this is his blurb for OUATIH: ""Finally, Tarantino asks audiences to think about life -- not just the movies."" THIS IS TARANTINO'S MOST MOVIE-IEST MOVIE OUT OF ALL HIS MOVIES, where did he get that from?! Way back, he called *I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry* a better gay themed film than *Brokeback Mountain*.

This is clearly a parody reviewer.  A contrarian looking for sensationalist headlines.  His critiques often reach so far up his own behind that they make no sense. Like when he ruined *Toy Story 3'*s chances for 100% because he felt it was just a mere merchandising grab with no story. Either he's joking or he's a freakin' lunatic. 

Look, I love some questionable films. I hate some beloved films. I'm sure we all do. But to have nearly a perfect track record on both accounts is clearly trolling. In the scheme of things, Rotten Tomatoes is not the most important thing in the world, but why is the site giving validity to a very clear troll? It'd be like electing Borat into the Senate. There has to be way more deserving reviewers that RT is ignoring to replace him with. Even if they're specifically looking for conservatives with wild views, there has to be even more of those that are giving genuine thoughts on films.",movies,1612836116,BluRayja,True,1,8,2021-02-08

Tell Me your favorite A24 and not so favorite movie and Why?,"Obviously there is lot to choose from and there is couple mediocre movies there too but I really like the like the directors who distribute their movie from a24. Mine would have to be Lady Bird just because of chemistry between Saoirse Ronan and Laurie Metcalf. The dialogue between them is so great and really related to relationship alot. To me it the great perception of coming of age movie.

Probably my least favorite from what I watch was Hot summer nights. I just hated the main character and act like he was top shit after selling a couple grams of weed.

"The Films of William Wyler racked up an insane 124 Competitive Oscar Nominations, is there any director with more?","Just to clarify, Wyler himself was only nominated 15 times, a record 12 nominations for Best Director, winning three. The rest of the 109 nominations came mainly from his canny ability to direct Oscar-worthy performances. But still that's insane nevertheless.

His consistency in curating a filmography made him a critical favorite for the Academy Awards. He was first nominated for Best Director in 1936 for Dodsworth and his final nomination was for The Collector in 1965. Among the likes of Frank Capra, John Ford, etc -- he was one of the great titans of the Golden Age of Hollywood.

Most of his nominations came from his classic films:

- Ben Hur (1959) -- Nominated for 12 awards, winning 11.

- Mrs Miniver (1942) -- Nominated for 12 awards, winning 6.

- Roman Holiday (1953) -- Nominated for 10 awards, winning 3.

- Best Years of Our Lives (1946) -- Nominated for 8 awards, winning 10 (this anomaly is mainly for winning honorary non-competitive awards).

Pretty much everything I've seen from him has been great. He's an incredibly versatile director with a great understanding of mortality and heart. Not sure who else would come close with his films racking up so many nominations. Perhaps John Ford or Steven Spielberg, I'm not sure. Either way, a great director!",movies,1612744224,CadoxiaFilmClub,True,4,19,2021-02-07

I don't remember the plot too well but there was a knock-off Bonnie and Clyde type thing going on. I think it was from the perspective of a girl who comes to stay with someone in this town and the town is known for having a couple like Bonnie and Clyde. I can't remember if it's that the girl ends up finding something of theirs or what but literally the only scene I do remember is that there was a big emphasis on red carnations because that was a thing the couple or the ""Clyde"" of the couple always had and the girl sees the ""Clyde"" in her dreams handing her a red carnation or something like that.

Extreme Prejudice (1987) How did I miss this Walter Hill classic?,"On one side you have Michael Ironside running a clandestine Zombie Unit, composed of soldiers reported to be killed-in-action, and on the other side you have Powers Boothe as a drug kingpin with his own Mexican army, then in the middle, you have Nick Nolte as a Cooperesque Texas Ranger.   Can it get better, sure it can, the Zombie unit includes the likes of Clancy Brown and William Forsythe, and on the Rangers side you have Rip Torn as Texas sheriff and best friend to Nolte and to round it all off you have María Conchita Alonso as the woman torn between Boothe and Nolte.

In what turns into a salute to Sam Peckinpah *Extreme Prejudice* shifts from being a story about a tough as nails Texas Ranger, to a bank heist movie until it climaxes into the finale of *The Wild Bunch*.

"Why does everyone hate ""The Rhythm Section""?","Last night I watched The Rhythm Section blind, without seeing a trailer or knowing much about it. I genuinely loved it. I loved the slow burn beginning, the realistic, brutal fight scenes, the stoic androgyny of the main character, the color scheme, chase scene, everything. So I go on rotten tomatoes and discover everyone hates it and that blows my mind.

I generally like these sort of female-lead assassin-thriller type movies. And I thought this one was actually better and more interesting than Ava, Anna and Red Sparrow. (but none of those were particularly awful either) So what gives? My only thought is that some people are made uncomfortable by the depressed female lead who isn't done up in makeup and bombshell hair and the gloomy atmosphere. I feel like if this was a male lead or a james bond movie it would at least have 50 or 60 percent on rotten tomatoes.",movies,1612306152,andyazel,True,0,27,2021-02-02

It doesn’t have to be old movies. I mean we all love the Jaws and Star Wars iconic movie posters, but I’m looking for a few posters that haven’t been so overly used or played out.  A few examples that I’m leaning towards are  

1. Once Upon A Time In Hollywood

2. Play Misty For Me
 
3.  Enter The Dragon (although kind of played out). 

4. Boogie Nights

5. The Joker Dark Knight poster

Den of Thieves(2018) ROCKS.,"Mind my wording. It's not a masterpiece, it's not particularly original, it's not even all that clever for a heist movie, it simply ROCKS. 

The plot is just ""these thieves want to steal money from the Fed, a cop tries to stop them."" 

The heist is really well done, but imho it's not even the most interesting part of this heist movie. 

The cop, played in a great way by Gerard Butler, is a MASTERFUL character. Not original, but again, he ROCKS. The biggest asshole in a movie about murdering criminals who literally rob the government, truly repugnant subversion of the whole ""Renegade cop"" except he is flat out and surface-level a power-tripping sociopath who is basically always the most powerful person in every room he is in, the authority he is rebelling against is just a FBI agent who is a vegan and does nothing the entire movie to antagonize him. Ample montages of him just being shitty. I don't think it's a really original take, but it's a very well done depiction of a guy like that. 

&gt;!The reveal doesn't make much sense, but it's really the dumb fun cherry on this dumb fun movie.!&lt;

Top Ten Films (with only one film per director allowed),"Hello, I was wondering what everyone's top ten favorite films list would look like if you could only have one film per director on it.  For example, if you have both Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark in your normal top ten, you would have to take one of them out for this list.  There are multiple films by Kubrick, Scorsese, and Hitchcock near the top of my favorites, but if I only had to include one from each and exclude all of their other films, my top ten would probably look like this, with the films being in no order except for the top few since I don't like ranking things:

2001: A Space Odyssey (Stanley Kubrick)

Psycho (Alfred Hitchcock)

Memories of Murder (Bong Joon-ho)

Taxi Driver (Martin Scorsese)

Fargo (Coen brothers)

Pulp Fiction (Quentin Tarantino)

One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Milos Foreman)

Network (Sidney Lumet)

The unofficial Nicolas Cage action trilogy of the late 90s,"I recently watched the remainder of the unofficial trilogy of 90s Nic Cage action films - Face Off and Con Air - for the first time.  I must say this is one wild, cheesy, and insane trilogy.  Having The Rock, Con Air and Face Off consecutively in a career is a high point.  These are all great examples of the good kind of cheese in blockbusters.  There are so many amazing one liners in these films and those completely made the films for me.   I'm curious to see how others rank these films.

The Rock - the best of the bunch.  Ed Harris' General Hummel really elevates the film and is simple to side with with due to his hopes.  Also, the Rocketman one liner/kill may be the single best moment in Michael Bay's filmography. 

Con Air - the cheesiest of the bunch but probably the most entertaining and fun.  The cast is so great and the characters are so memorable in their own way.  The chase at the end is one of my favourite chases in any action movie and Cameron Poe is a very likable character.  Most importantly, the whole bunny and box scene is made perfection with Cage's accent. 

Face Off - the craziest and most insane of the bunch.  It is too wild for words but Cage and Travolta play their parts so well.  The action is delightfully over the top and the beginning shootout plus the plane crash (which was also done well in Tenet) is action movie perfection.  Every one liner is excellent and the scene where Sean first meets Troy at the prison is probably peak John Travolta.  As enjoyable as it is, I think it is the worst of the bunch - most of the prison stuff kind of dragged to me and the film could have been a bit shorter.

I still have to see the rest of Cage's work (I have only seen the ones mentioned, some of his animated films and Kick Ass) and would like if anyone could recommend a great starting point for the more dramatic Cage work.",movies,1612311209,Person884,True,49,76,2021-02-02

A movie about a colony of humans trying to survive and repopulate on an alien planet,"*\*Minor Spoilers For Interstellar*

Hi guys, I'm looking for a movie or tv show that's about the colonization of humans on an alien planet. This has been a topic I've been intrigued in for awhile, but I just finished watching Interstellar last night and I kind of just wanted to continue that narrative where we see the beginning stages of humans trying to live on a new planet. We got a bit of that with The Martian, but it would be cool to see a movie like that with an entire colony of people. I also would have loved to have seen more on the Cooper station as-well. I think I just like seeing Humans living in a vastly new, futuristic environment (or futuristic circumstances).

Below Zero - new Spanish movie - a good film with major plotholes," 

I quite liked the movie. Acting, directing, music and overall story were quite nice. Plot twists were unexpected yet natural.

Spoilers ahead:

First visible stretching of the plot comes with total lack of GPS and cellphones, back to 80s I guess with walkie talkies. Also, no cars at all passing there to report the carnage?

However, what bothered me more is how much information Miguel had on Nano's crime. Presumably, he got that info from the kid he kills at the beginning of the movie, meaning he kidnapped and tortured that guy just on suspicion. Even then, it is not likely the victim would go into such detail how they tortured, raped, mutilated and killed the little girl. Simple- we raped her and accidentally strangled her would be much more likely. So, the speech Miguel has with all the gruesome details is there only to make us like him and make us hate Nano so much that we enjoy watching his hand get blown to bits. It almost makes you forget that Miguel directly killed 3 completely innocent cops and indirectly 4 prisoners who were more or less undeserving of death. And Nano survives, albeit pretty fucked up. All in all, Miguel is a psychopath who killed 8 people (7 innocent and unrelated to the crime) to find out where are remains of his daughters. because he promised it to his wife.

I feel bad for Martin, he will have so much regret over things he did that day.",movies,1612313674,Brigadir32,True,6,8,2021-02-02

What are some B&amp;W films with especially good or striking use of lighting?,"I teach a high school film class. Putting together a unit focused on lighting and I'd like to have a few different options for students to pick from to study for this unit.

I'm sticking strictly to B&amp;W films, because 1) I think removing color as a factor allows students to focus more on light, darkness/brightness, etc. and 2) we have a unit all about color coming up anyway, so this is my last chance to expose the kids to some classic B&amp;W films.

So far, I've come up with *The Third Man* as well as *The Treasure of the Sierra Madre*. I'm also considering *Godzilla*... I'm rewatching it as I type this to see if the lighting is particularly interesting. Any other suggestions?

Keep in mind the audience for this is high school students, some of whom have the attention span of a fly, so accessibility is key! (As it is, it's already an ordeal to get them excited about something like *The Third Man...)*",movies,1612134845,Saepod,True,5,100,2021-01-31

Gone Girl: Basically A Fictionalized Version of Laci/Scott Petereson Real Life Case,"Back in 2014, the highly anticipated movie adaptation of the NYT bestseller *Gone Girl* hit theatres and made roughly $370 million worldwide. I remember being worried about it, to be honest -- I had absolutely loved the book and am always worried when I watch an adaptation of  a novel I loved. But I was the opposite of disappointed. It rocked. But I digress. 

Since then, I’ve become much more into true crime and familiarized with some of the more famous cases. And when I watched *Gone Girl* this weekend, well, my sensors were going off. The whole thing is basically the Laci/Scott Peterson case (with a different ending). 

Let’s check out the similarities: 

# The “Grieving” Husband

Scott Peterson and his Gone Girl counterpart Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) were each considered the perfect, All-American husbands, ostensibly: Beautiful homes, “happy” marriages, good career. But in truth, they were struggling — financially especially. Scott was in major debt before Laci went missing, and the character of Nick lived mostly off his wife’s trust fund. 

And in both cases, collecting life insurance off their wives was a motive considered by prosecutors.

The post-crime optics also mirror each other: just like Affleck’s Nick, Scott struggled to show any true emotion while his wife was missing. 

(Also director David Fincher once said, Ben Affleck “looks more like Scott Peterson than Ben Affleck,” and the movie becomes even creepier.

# The Beautiful, Missing Wife

The disappearance of Amy Dunne (Rosamund Pike) in the book is not far off from Laci’s. Amy disappeared without a trace on the Dunnes’ anniversary. Although not an anniversary, Laci went missing while walking the couple’s dog on Christmas Eve — another important day. 

And during the search, both women were portrayed as the picture of sweetness and beauty. (obviously, Amy was….not that. But that’s later.)

# The Pregnancy

Pregnancy factors into both tales, though in the case of Laci, her ending was much more heartbreaking. She was eight months pregnant with her and Scott’s first child when she went missing. 

Nick and Amy Dunne had previously tried to get pregnant in the book, and in the end, the no-longer-missing Amy announced she’s expecting. (But in the book/film, Unfortunately, it was all just to stop her husband from revealing the truth about her “disappearance.”)

# The Media Circus

The most clearly borrowed moments in *Gone Girl* are those that deal with the press. 

In both cases, a press conference was held and vigils were organized by the families. Scott and Nick we reach confronted with questions about whether he’s a suspect, (though in real life Scott stormed off instead of answering. And all the coverage was spearheaded by a cable news host obsessed with the case — in real life, it was HLN’s Nancy Grace, and in the novel, it was Ellen Abbott.

Gillian Flynn says that it’s not based on it,  but it’s very clear that Fincher had it on his mind when he did the film. So what do we think?

Remembering a movie wrong - Ronin (1998),"Ever remember something very clearly in a movie, only to rewatch the movie and find out you remembered it wrong?

There's a line in Ronin (1998) that De Niro's character Sam says to Dierdre near the end of the movie telling her to walk away, and all this time I remembered it being something to the effect of:  ""Walk away, walk away... we're all ronin... we've been shamed...""

I just rewatched the movie first time in awhile and it was really strange experience. There were some things I don't remember, like the scene at the stadium among the tourists. But that one line I remember vividly, and the whole time I'm waiting for that one line, cause it never made sense to me. 

And I get to that line... and it's NOT what De Niro says.

And it's a huge relief, cause the actual line makes the movie a whole lot better. But it was so clear in my head I wondered if there were alternate versions, and originally came here to ask if other people had seen that version. Looking at the actual quote, I think I must have just substituted the words in my head. 

That was really weird. Kinda like how I was waiting for Richard Parker to start talking in Life of Pi, but that's a different story.",movies,1612138075,degeneral,True,0,2,2021-01-31

Or was she a Creole in world views?,"Wiki says in addition to refusing to acting in Hollywood because most of the roles she could find early in her career was as in her words huehuenches and even after big refused major roles alongside A listers because she felt she was being typecast (and ironically Ava Gardner and other top stars would play those roles instead, her father was an officer in the Army thus implying upper class Mestiza or even Criollo.

So would she be snobbish by today's morals and if so, was she a high grade racist or simply a woman of her times? Or did she have a liberal tint but still kept in line with the upper classes enough she wouldn't enjoy doing stuff associated with non-white ethnic backgrounds and lower classes such as eating burritos, drinking beer, dancing the tango, watching anime, and playing basketball?

Out of all the actors/actresses that replaced other actors in sequels/spin-offs which one did you like the best?,"Sometimes in sequels or spin-offs the actor that originally played a character isn't available to reprise their role so someone else to step in and do it which inevitably leads to them being compared to the original actor.  Out of all the actors that had to do this, which ones did you like the best?  This includes both live-action roles and voice-acting ones.

For live-action I think Don Cheadle was great in the Iron Man sequels, I did feel bad for Howard and was annoyed that he got screwed over by Ike Perlmutter(who wanted to pay Howard less because he's a racist moron) but Cheadle won me over pretty quick.

For voice-acting it's Ralph Waite in Homeward Bound 2, it was difficult to imagine anyone else playing Shadow after what an amazing job Don Ameche did in the first one, but Waite definitely delivered as he sounds almost exactly like Ameche(to the point where as a kid I had no clue it was a different guy voicing Shadow)and puts the same effort and pathos into the role.",movies,1612141685,diamondedges,True,1,139,2021-01-31

"I know it's already been said, but damn it, I'm gonna say it again, Peter Jackson's King Kong is a masterpiece.","After LOTR, Peter Jackson created a reputation for himself as one of the best film makers out there, so his follow up film was going to be a monumental task.

And then he delivers King Kong. Her took a classic monster movie and made it his own. Kong has always been knows as a giant ape that walks upright. PJ decided to go agaisnt the grain and make  a 50ft silverback gorilla. A delivered.

The cinematography is amazing, SFX are on point, and that soundtrack. Damn.

Also, the minutes leading up to King's death and freaking heartbreaking. It would almost bring a tear to a grown man's eye.

I just wanted to take a minute to appreciate this masterpiece with the upcoming Godzilla vs Kong film coming out.

Good Movie Video Games,"Not too long ago I started a topic about worst movie video games, with how bad so many movies licensed from video games often turn out. It's true there's so many terrible movie-licensed games, but like everything else, there's also good ones and actually quite a few of them if you really look. What are the movie-licensed video games that stand out as being really good and worthy of their licenses?

GoldenEye for the N64 is an immediate no-brainer. Talk about an exception to the rule. Barring the dated graphics, I'm hard-pressed to think of anything bad about it. Jurassic Park has been treated a lot better than most with video games as a lot of them are genuinely very good, especially the ones for the Genesis and SNES, and the JP Arcade games were also a lot of fun. JP: Rampage Edition for the Genesis is especially awesome, basically Contra with dinosaurs. The Ghostbusters Genesis game is another that's enjoyable (and there of course the very good 2009 game which is basically the canon third movie), and the Arcade game based on the original RoboCop is very fun (if quite tough). Although not exactly based directly on any of the films from it's respective series, the RoboCop Vs. Terminator Genesis game is a classic. So many memories of that as a kid, and it's still fun to play. True Lies for the SNES is surprisingly good considering it was made by the infamous LJN.

There's many enjoyable Alien and Predator games too, not just most of the AVP ones. The Aliens Arcade game, Alien 3: The Gun for the Arcade and also the Alien 3 and Predator 2 Genesis games are fun.

Some more off the top of my head that are good and much better than average for most movie VGs are Batman and Gremlins 2 for the NES and Super Star Wars for the SNES. I never played Super Empire Strikes Back or Return Of The Jedi, but the first Super Star Wars game is great. Although taking some considerable liberties with the movie, it made an effort to closely follow the plot and even has the music and sound effects from the movie which made it feel that much more authentic.

I actually named quite a few there. Seems there's a lot more good movie VGs than previously thought. I notice when it comes to decent movie-licensed games, the Sega Genesis seemed to have better luck than most. Not to say it wasn't without it's share of lousy ones (I'm looking at you, Cliffhanger and RoboCop 3), but it seemed to frequently have it's shared of decent movie-licensed games and moreso than the other consoles at the time. The three Jurassic Park games, RoboCop Vs. The Terminator, the Terminator 2 Arcade port and side-scroller (the side-scroller is actually pretty decent once you get past the bad driving stages and repetitive music), Alien 3 and Predator 2, Ghostbusters, Batman and Aladdin.",movies,1611962296,Skeleton_Warrior,True,1,16,2021-01-29
Raya and the Last Dragon - representation and casting,"So I've seen a couple of articles with regards to the casting of some East Asian actors as opposed to South East Asian actors in this film. And I'm interested in everyone's thoughts and the nuances of the subject and sensitivities. Of course this isn't specific to this movie. There have been numerous controversies over the past few years, in both the animated world and live-action world, pertaining to both cast and crew and relating to race, gender, sexuality, and nationality. 

I suppose my default feeling is that if we go down the route of such specificity of casting actors who are only cast because of those traits (ie. you can only play a gay character if you're gay, SE Asian if you're Asian, trans if you're trans) then at what point are we both limiting the art of acting and also limiting the roles available to everyone (as a Brit, an example may be should a Scot play an English person, or even should a Brit play an American. I also saw criticism of Daniela Kaluuya playing a black American and that the role should have gone to an American person). Does it work both ways? 

Also, should these concerns be limited to cast and be extended to crew? Or even writers? And what extreme does it get taken to? That you can't write for men if you're not a man, or women if you're not a woman? With such diversity in western culture, is this all to do with some kind of authenticity or truth? 

Again, I'm really interested in the nuances of the cultural discussion, if there's a tipping point for either side, if so when that is? Is it about opportunity for minorities? Is it about voice and cultural truth?

I'm interested in learning from different viewpoints, not a 'political correctness gone mad' type discussion.",movies,1611962453,iamthedon,True,1,8,2021-01-29

What are your thoughts on the future of movie theaters?,"Personally, I still haven’t been to a movie theater since the pandemic started and while I miss going, I can also see myself coping well enough even if theaters had to close down forever.  Even prior to the pandemic, theaters (AFAIK in the US)  were already on the decline due to the growing popularity of streaming services and the growing quality of original films from these various services.  I wonder whether post-pandemic, if people will go back to movie theaters in droves, or even if that happens, whether or not theaters can bounce back from the huge blow they took due to the pandemic/lockdowns.

What do you think?  Are the various anticipated films that were delayed to be released in 2021/2022 be enough to help the theater industry bounce back?  

Or is the decline we were seeing pre-pandemic continue to play out post-pandemic.

Will what Disney did with Mulan be the new norm?  Even though it was a shit film, millions of people gladly paid the fee to stream the film at home.

In places, like New Zealand, where the pandemic has been eradicated, are theaters back in full-force and in pre-pandemic popularity?  Or have people gotten comfortable with just staying in to watch films even with the lockdowns lifted.",movies,1611965773,chilldotexe,True,1,39,2021-01-29

# Trading Places ([1983](https://www.imdb.com/year/1983/?ref_=tt_ov_inf)). I love this movie because it shows how the ""rich"" can play their games but it will eventually bite them in the ass.

Tenet is actually a masterpiece,"I truly believe this is one of the best movies ever made. Everything about Tenet is just so well crafted and well thought out, it oozes originality and quality. From the marvellous cinematography to the well-written dialogues and sound editing.. Nolan is truly a genius filmmaker and one of the best of his generation easily. He's got the abilty and talent to create a world in a way that makes the viewer naturally invested in the story he's telling. Can't forget the amazing casting by the way, John David Washington is especially good and Robert Pattinson delivers a captivating supporting performance. Some people say the opposite but I do think the characters are very relatable and not souless at all. And the score!! awesome

Yes, the story is a bit confusing (which is not a bad thing in my view, it's just supposed to be that way) but once you decide to dive deeper into the concept and the many details of the story and give it so time, everything will start making sense and pay off. Give Nolan all the Oscars!",movies,1611968905,lonesome__,True,1,16,2021-01-29

"Rami Malek's intense facial expressions in ""The Little Things""","Searched for a discussion thread on this film and was surprised nothing came up besides a topic about the poster. 

For what it's worth, I really liked Mr Robot and thought Rami Malek was pretty good as Freddie Mercury. But I'm 3/4 of the way through this movie, and to say that Malek hams it up is a bit of an understatement. I've had to pause the movie at numerous points to observe/chuckle at his super-intense, icy, pursed-lips-and-bulging-eyes facial expressions. 

I feel like someone is going to end up making a compilation of them and it'll go viral. It's the sort of thing where once you notice it, you can't not see it.

The movie itself, I'm pretty underwhelmed by. It's a pasable B thriller with A list stars who are maybe unsure of the right tone to strike. I'm not sure if they are given much help by the dialogue, either. I wouldn't say it's bad but it's certainly not something I'd watch again.",movies,1611971699,paulrudder,True,1,50,2021-01-29

Not only is it one hell of an action film, it's also so damn perfect in so many aspects that aren't even necessary for a good action flick. From its subversion of tropes to the cinematography to all the small details you only notice on second, third or fourth viewing. Not to mention the absolutely insane, perfectly choreographed practical effects.

And all that done by a director who hasn't made an action film in 30 years, and whose previous two films were Happy Feet and Happy Feet 2. And let's not get into the 10+ years the film was in development hell.

It's still blowing my mind that this film got made in the 2010's.

"Soul was a terrible film, and I'll tell you why."," NOT TRYING TO BE DEBBIE DOWNER. I just had this weird feeling that wouldn't go away, so I dug deeper. 

This is about trying to be an ally who actually cares to read deeper into the way Hollywood offers up stories about black lives. So this isn't a challenge of your enjoyment of the film, it's a challenge of my enjoyment of the film and feeling something was off.  

In this year, I'm more attuned to it than ever, obvs. If you don't want your happy whiteness challenged about the movie ""Soul"", don't read this.  Essentially, it's an insensitive and weird bizarro-world form of Get Out, and ends up an uncomfortable white savior story that fully marginalizes a black man, his dreams, and his self worth. It's a ""swap narrative"", and it's really bad.

I didn't know why I hated it after watching it (doing that ""Oh everyone enjoyed it so I am sure i did too), then proceeded to ignore it as a ""I am an idiot"" moment that I have about 4 or 5 times a day.

But the plot was vacuous, the storyline meant nothing... and the pseudo-religious metaphysical subplots were just absurd. I hated that immediately. The movie is fun to look at tho. But it's like Damon Lindelof level nonsense to use macguffins and unanswerable questions to appear ""deep and smart"".

So.. I don't like when I feel way off from the zeitgeist, and researched it a bit.

Black reviewers did not warm to it like white reviewers.

This is the must read if you choose not to ignore the complexity and just want to watch a dumb cartoon. It's not an indictment on your belief systems or morals to just want to watch a movie and forgo the process of assimilating that pop culture into your own existence, but it's a useful tool to realize no movie is an island, and both what made it and its impact fit into the overall world of culture, and then has an impact on said culture. So if you read one review, read this one: ---&gt;    
""it betrays the black antagonist for white good""

and mentions this other review:

&gt;In his review, critic Kambole Campbell compares Soul to another recent movie about the theft of Black bodies: “In a decade of film where Jordan Peele’s Get Out became part of our cultural lexicon, it makes one wonder why someone didn’t think through the plot device of a character voiced by a white actress piloting a Black man’s body. With all the film’s canniness about Black living, to see such a moment completely divorced from any kind of political thought feels completely bizarre and somewhat infuriating in how easily it could have been avoided.”  

Another reviewer, African American Woman:

&gt;Once again, Black audiences would have to deal with seeing a Black character not experience life through their body. In a year in which more attention has been paid to Black death than ever before, Soul‘s adherence to yet another unnecessary Black out-of-body experience becomes even more tonally dissonant than it was before. [https://colorwebmag.com/2020/12/28/mo-reviews-soul-disney-pixar/](https://colorwebmag.com/2020/12/28/mo-reviews-soul-disney-pixar/)

White critics didn't like it as well.... and although not as nuanced, I feel like they represent my white privileged and naivety born ignorance, and the way a white person can feel the film is ""off"", without being able to describe it because we do not possess the experience of what it means to be black in America. Whatever the case, these are great and incisive, even if Martin's queries are less than specific about what he didn't enjoy.

&gt;The movie removes parenting and life experience from the concept of personality and offensively implies -- in this year of all years -- that those who don’t survive near-death experiences pass away because of a lack of inspiration or determination.    
Seriously, it’s astonishing how many mixed/terrible messages occur in this underwritten, manipulative story of an unappreciated musical genius who also needs to focus less on his art:

People need to live fully but only in a particular way, finding their creative motivation but not letting it dominate your life

People who give everything to their craft are limiting themselves but are also top choices to be mentors to others

Learn from that genius mentor but don’t try too hard to follow in their footsteps

Joe is selfish and one-dimensional but worthy of afterlife validation yet also living incorrectly but also just needs to have more childlike wonder

Souls need bodies to appreciate tastes and smells but not sounds

No other souls feel it’s not their time to go, as if Joe’s the only one feeling like he wants more before he dies

People receive “complete personalities” before birth that are a result of randomly assigned characteristics having nothing to do with DNA but also Joe thought he hated jazz until his dad brought him to a particular show

Being “in the zone” is beautiful and ideal but also don’t try to do that too much or care too much because that’s an “obsession” that takes you away from life, as if that passion isn’t part of your life

Joe’s determination to live inspires 22 to see the value in life even though Joe’s priorities are deemed inappropriate and foolish

Joe is likable and kind but is also a total loner in his 40s who is dangerously fixated on his career and can’t believe someone is happy without having their dream job

Why the autistic community is boycotting Sia’s film Music,"I’ve only seen a few posts about this here and most of them have been kind of out of context and possibly gave the wrong idea of the situation, so I wanted to try to do a simple explanation as to what’s the controversy around Sia’s upcoming film Music, directed towards people who aren’t necessarily that familiar with the autistic community. Music has already been released in Australia and it’s set to premiere in February in most other places. Here is the basic idea of the plot from Wikipedia: “Zu (Kate Hudson), a newly sober drug dealer and self-saboteur finds herself the sole guardian of her teenaged (minor), autistic half-sister, Music (Maddie Ziegler), following the death of her grandmother, who raised Music.” From the posts here I feel like many people have gotten the impression that the reason for the boycott is only the argument as to who is allowed to play autistic characters, but there is more to it and I’ll try to explain some of the reasons here.

&amp;#x200B;

**1.	Sia hired a non-autistic actress and when criticized about the decision, she insulted an autistic actor.**

In November 2020 Sia was facing backlash on Twitter for her decision to cast Maddie Ziegler, a non-autistic actress, to play Music. She defended her choice by saying that she tried to cast an autistic actress, who ended up finding it too challenging and had to drop out of the project. Twitter user HelenAngel responded “Several autistic actors, myself included, responded to these tweets. We all said we could have acted in it on short notice. These excuses are just that- excuses. The fact of the matter is zero effort was made to include anyone who is actually autistic.” to which Sia replied to, in a now deleted tweet, [“Maybe you’re just a bad actor”.](https://www.insider.com/sia-music-movie-autism-criticism-backlash-response-twitter-2020-11)

It’s later been suspected that the story about hiring an autistic actress was a lie all along, because in the talk show The Project, Sia said [she couldn’t do a project without](https://people.com/movies/sia-defends-casting-maddie-ziegler-in-music-movie-role/) Maddie:

""*I realized it wasn't ableism — I mean, it is ableism, I guess, as well — but it's actually nepotism, because I can't do a project without her, I don't want to. I wouldn't make art if it didn't include her*.” 

Whether disabled roles should always be played by disabled people is a matter of opinion, but here are some statistics about disability and work. According to the [Ruderman](https://www.rudermanfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/TV-White-Paper_7-1-003.pdf) foundation, 5% of disabled roles on screen are played by disabled actors. Currently 20% of the people in the US are considered disabled, and 1 in every 54 people are autistic. Only 16% of autistic adults in the UK are in full time employment. It is harder for disabled actors to find roles, since most characters are non-disabled and if your disability is visible from the outside for example through your body language, you’re going to get rejected. It seems hypocritical of Sia to make a film where she celebrates the autistic character Music and hopes to relieve the negativity around autism, when she won’t hire disabled/autistic people and won’t make accommodations in her set so that an autistic actor would’ve been comfortable. She also directly admitted she was being ableist with her casting choice. 

**2.	She refuses to use the word “disabled”**

Again, this is one of those things that can be a matter of personal preference. If a disabled person prefers to use words like special ability or differently abled, that’s completely okay. But this is also something that disability rights activists have been fighting for for years. By refusing to use the word disabled, it makes it sound like being disabled is a bad thing. Disability activists want disabled to be a neutral term, which is why it’s important to use it. This is a big thing in the autistic community so this seems to show Sia’s lack of knowledge and preparation for making a film about autism.

**3.	She worked together with Autism speaks, which is a hated organization**

Sia’s main collaborator and source for information was Autism speaks, which has an [extremely bad reputation](https://autisticmama.com/do-not-support-autism-speaks/) among autistic people. Autism speaks is an organization with an aim to cure autism and it’s run by non-autistic people. Autism advocates consider being neurodivergent a richness and their main goal is to find ways to make life for autistic people easier, but most autism advocates don’t want a cure for autism. Only 22% of their budget goes to fundraising efforts, and their marketing tactics have often increased negative stereotypes and stigma around autism rather than spread awareness.

**4.	She instructed Maddie to use Autism meltdown videos on Youtube as inspiration**

In an interview with Marie Claire Maddie Ziegler said she had prepared by watching meltdown videos on Youtube: “*To prepare, she studied documentaries about autism and watched YouTube videos by parents who recorded their child’s episodes*.”

In the autistic community these videos are considered exploitative and harmful. They show the child in the most vulnerable state, they’re posted by parents without the child’s consent and they don’t serve any purpose that would help the child or autistic people in general. Autism advocates [have campaigned](https://www.change.org/p/youtube-ban-videos-of-children-s-autism-meltdowns-on-youtube) to have these videos banned from Youtube.

For a neurotypical person this could be compared to having a panic attack, even though it’s a different thing. Imagine a parent filming their child crying and having a panic attack, then posting that on Youtube for everyone to see.

**5.	The film shows a harmful technique which has killed and injured dozens of children**

In a leaked scene of the film, Music has a meltdown and their neighbor Ebo rushes in to help her by laying on top of her. This is called prone or supine restraint, and it is a dangerous technique that is now advised against. In the US at least [20 children have died since 2001](https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9b89/deadly-restraints-are-being-used-on-children-at-youth-homes-and-schools) because of being restrained like this. Many of these children have been autistic or disabled. Showing this technique in a film as a good way to help meltdowns is possibly dangerous misinformation that could lead to people trying to help autistic people by restraining them.

&amp;#x200B;

So these were some of the reasons the autistic community is boycotting Sia’s film. The film contains possibly harmful misinformation and many autism advocates feel like Sia has not taken the autistic community’s opinions in to consideration while making the film. She has instructed Maddie to prepare for the role in a way that is exploitative of autistic children and many autistic people feel that the film is infantilizing of them and meant to be kind of inspiration porn rather than a realistic portrayal of autism. I’m not going to tell anyone whether or not they should boycott the film, I think that is everyone’s own decision, but I wanted to explain what’s going on. It would be really interesting to hear people’s thoughts about this.

For more information about this case, the Instagram account Autisticats has a highlight dedicated to this. Here’s also another article about it:

No Country For Old Men---One wrong note?,"Cormac McCarthy is one of our greatest contemporary authors. The Coen Brothers are two of our best filmmakers. And No Country For Old Men is the masterful result of their collaboration. It's just the ending that I can't quite reconcile. 

Both Cormac and the Coens use a lot of violence and bloodshed. But it's pretty much integral to the plot and the characters every time. Except this once. And it's not even the gruesome broken arm that bothers me---I was as fascinated with it as those two kids on their bikes were. My problem is why? What do we learn about Chigurh that we didn't know? Or about the plot or anything else? It just seems tagged on at the end for no good reason. I would have been perfectly happy if he had just checked his boots after killing Carla Jean and walked off into the credits.

GOOD or BAD: Men in Black II (2002),"Released in 2002, the sequel to 1997's Men in Black saw the return of Barry Sonnenfeld as director and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as our two main protagonists. It follows Agent Jay as tries to find Agent Kay and restore his memory to stop an evil alien seductress. 

MIB II also stars Lara Flynn Boyle as the shapeshifting villain Serleena, Johnny Knoxville as Serleena's henchman, Rosario Dawson as a long-lost alien princess, and David Cross in a small role. 

Now I think an argument can be made for MIB II being the weakest of the original MIB trilogy, but after seeing MIB International, I would choose to watch this movie in a heartbeat.

The Future of Fast and Furious,"I’ve watched all these movies and after some thought I’m pretty sure I’ve cracked the trajectory the movies are on. I present the future movies of the Fast and Furious franchise: 


Fast and Furious 9:
The how or why isn’t important but the crew have to escape Charlize Theron’s Volcano lair as it erupts and pours lava over the side. They have to drive around the inside like a motorcycle globe of death to build the momentum to escape as the lava rises. Then they launch out and have to drive down the side as the lava chases them. Charlize Theron escapes in the madness. 

Fast and Furious 10:  
Not really sure the crux of the story but at the end they have to deal with a ticking down atomic bomb that Charlize Theron has set off. Their only option is to drop it in the middle of the ocean using Boat-cars. Roman is forced to drive a rubber duck pedalo with a bugatti engine in it. They are chased across the ocean by Charlize’s henchmen firing uzi while riding jet skis. They just about outrun the mushroom cloud. You can see the slight char on Torettos Von Dutch shirt. 

Fast and Furious 11: Quarter Lightyear at a Time
They have to travel to space to have a final face off with Charlize Theron who has built a space station which can take control of all satellites. The Rock returns in this movie and punches a comet out the way. At the end they drive through a wormhole to avoid dying in the explosion from the space base. 

Fast and Furious 12: Next Engineration
We are now in an alternate universe with teen versions of all the characters. With loads of reference jokes to the previous movies. Nicolas Cage is the new bad guy who's holding a monopoly over nitrous oxide which he sells to the local Mafia. After the credits the old characters come through the wormhole and meet the young versions. 

Fast and Furious 13: 
This is a team up movie with the adult and teen versions of the crew working together. Nicolas Cage returns as the bad guy and combines himself with a car to take the crew down. The final showdown taking place at Cages scrapyard in a destruction derby style showdown. 

Fast and Furious 14:
The young and old Tej manage to recreate the wormhole technology. The old characters drive through the wormhole again hoping to return home but unfortunately the dying Nicolas Cage drives into the wormhole machine in a fit of revenge. The wormhole scrambles and the crew is bounced to the wrong universe. The whole crew is turned into cars and voice the cars for the rest of the movie. Sharlto Copley voices the main antagonist car. King Booka plays a Hummer.

Fast Fifteen
The young Tej manages to fix the wormhole machine and triangulates the old crew. They jump through wearing protective mechanic overalls. The young characters remain human and drive the cars voiced by the old characters as the two crews are on the run in this car populated world. 

Fast and Furious 16:
Having escaped the car authorities the crews managed to find refuge long enough to getting the wormhole machine fired up again. Unfortunately the authorities catch up to them and they must all jump through without the protective mechanic overalls. They jump through the wormhole but end up this time in a universe where the cars drive them. Vin is driven by a mustang and runs on corona. None of the original actors talk in this movie, they are all mocapped in as the “cars”. Imagine the actors just lying down with wheels attached to their shoulders and knees. A whole new cast is needed to voice the cars driving the crew.

Fast and Furious 17: Universes Collide
Every version of the characters from the multiverse are rounded up, sedated and have their consciousness downloaded into the Omega Quarter Mile to race off against the multiverses greatest racer and his cronies.

Dumbest common complaints you've heard about movies,"""Why are there so many movies and/or TV shows set in New York?""

New York has a giant population of aspiring actors and filmmakers. Many, many famous actors, screenwriters, filmmakers, and producers live in New York so sometimes they like to film something that's close to him. A lot of movie and TV studios have locations set in New York and sometimes they like filming something close to him. There's also apparently some tax code thingies that makes it affordable to film in New York but I don't know the first thing about economics so don't ask me about that. 

THAT is why there are so many movies set in New York. What doesn't make sense is why there are a fair amount of animated movies set in New York or movies set in New York that are filmed in Vancouver. If you have no incentive to actually film in New York and make use of all the creatives living there, why bother even setting it in the first place?

""Why do they make movies about the making of movies?""

Why not? Let people tell stories about whatever they want to tell it about it within reason. If people want to make movies about people making a movie and it's well written, well acted, looks great, etc., then have at it I say! Plus there are many fascinating behind the scenes stories about movie making, if anything Hollywood has only scraped the surface there.",movies,1611615350,mranimal2,True,1,0,2021-01-25

The Bride/Beatrix Kiddo from Kill Bill is kind of a hypocrite,"Spoilers, spoilers, obviously. But it's a pretty old movie, you've had time to watch it, whatever.

When Kiddo attack Vernita Green, Green tells Kiddo that, since putting Kiddo in a coma, killing her fiance, and supposedly causing Kiddo to miscarry, Green had become married and a mother herself, and that this had changed her, so she didn't wish to die. Kiddo responds by blowing her off, and that getting knocked up doesn't change anything.

Later, when Kiddo is talking to Bill prior to killing him, Bill asserts that Kiddo would always be an assassin and a cold-blooded killer, incapable of changing. Kiddo retorts that she would've changed for her baby, to become a mother.

So, does Kiddo believe that becoming a mother can fundamentally change who you are, or does she think that nobody can ever change and become less deserving of getting killed? Hell, she basically invites Green's kid to come and perpetuate an unending cycle of violence, but we're supposed to side with the former contract assassin? Because, what, her ex boyfriend and boss almost did to her what he certainly paid her to do to tons of other people?

I'm not saying Kill Bill isn't a good movie, just that it seems a bit muddled in its messaging.",movies,1611616411,MrAcurite,True,1,1,2021-01-25

I just rewatched The Dark Knight Rises. I almost forgot how utterly cringe inducing the death scene of Miranda Tate was. I actually laughed out loud when she did her little head tilt.

Are there any movies even remotely similar to 'Bone Tomahawk' (read description please)?,"Man Bone Tomahawk kept me gripped throughout, had an amazing plot with very good acting, and it also had intensity revved up by its insane violence.

I've been looking for months and I have only found 'Green Room', 'Prisoners, and 'I Saw the Devil' to be similar.

I'm not looking for specifically a Western movie, but I want something that has a good plot and eqaully disturbing violence.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, when I try to find similar movies, there is disturbing violence, but the plot is extremely weird / absurd. Besides the 4 listed above, I haven't found a movie that retains the qualities that Bone Tomahawk has without sacrificing its intensity / plot quality.",movies,1611618424,midnightchristmas,True,1,1,2021-01-25
Questions about The Taking of Pelham 123 (1974),"Hey Cinephiles - especially New Yorkers,

I watched The Taking of Pelham 123 last night. I got some questions:

1) According to the Wikipedia entry Walter Mathau's character, Transit cop Garber, is ""obsessive-compulsive."" Does anyone know why he'd be described this way? I didn't see it.

2) One of the conflicts is the request that a million dollars be delivered to the subway car in an hour. The speeding cop car crashes on the way. Theoretically, the police/mayor's office would coordinate a pick up the million from the closest banks. I don't think it's said, but is the subtext that the money has to be provided by the New York Treasury in Lower Manhattan?

3. Are there any specific reasons that the hijackers would have selected the Pelham, in that direction, stopping it where they did? I wonder if there is context I'm missing.

What are some movies that have the most overinflated IMDb / Letterbox ratings ?,"We all know that sites like IMDb and Letterbox are subject to fairly significant sample bias based on the demographics of the user base. As a result, there are definitely some headscratchers on the IMDb top 250 list. 

In my opinion the best examples of this are The Dark Knight and Pulp Fiction. These are definitely great movies, but according to IMDb the Dark Knight is the 4th best movie ever made and Pulp Fiction is the 8th best....this seems a little off. 

The Dark Knight, as well some other movies like Logan and Winter Soldier, are comic book movies that try to present themselves as ""dark and gritty"" and they dip their toes in some more mature themes and different genres. This is appealing to comic book movie fans, because ultimately they still share the same DNA as every other comic book movie, but on the surface they are more serious films (despite being just as silly at its roots). While they are well made movies, they are also quite pretentious, and many people seem to mistake their gritty and self-serious tone for these being above other comic book movies. I understand the sentiment, but I feel like most people who view these types of dark superhero movies as masterpieces probably need to broaden their horizons outside of the comic book realm. 

In the case of Pulp Fiction, I think for a lot of people watching this movie kinda feels like the first time you get drunk. For many people this movie was the gateway between mainstream blockbusters and indie movies and more obscure films from the past. Is it really a top 10 movie ever made? Probably not, but it certainly appeals to teenagers",movies,1611620569,Ornery_Captain,True,1,0,2021-01-25

Why I did not like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"I watched it last night and thought it was crap. Okay, maybe ‘crap’ is a little strong, but I didn’t think it was as good as everyone kept telling me. It has an 85% certified fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes, a 70% approved audience rating. 

Are they spouting complete bullshit? Did they even see Once Upon a Time in Hollywood? Because I did. And I never would have described that movie the way they did.

In terms of what makes a movie, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood isn’t bad. It’s not a bad movie. It had a great cast, Brad and Leo did impeccable jobs acting, they blew it out of the water. The spray tans were a bit much, but I suppose I can overlook that as “historical accuracy.” The camera work was marvelous, each scene was expertly crafted to show and reveal exactly what was needed in the moment. The soundtrack was exquisitely tailored to bring the viewers right back to 1969 and immerse us in that period. And of course, we can’t forget the outfits, the cars, the old-fashioned Taco Bell with its neon lights that gleams in the heart of Los Angeles, all terrific.

Visually, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is stunning. Visually, it lives up the hype, the gushing reviews, the award nominations, the raving fans. But as a story, it falls flat.

While Brad and Leo pulled out all the stops with their acting, there is only so much they can do to cover up a flatly written character. Or a poorly written plot.
The main character of the movie, by a smidgen, is (to me) Cliff Booth with a sidekick role for Rick Dalton. The movie gives both almost an equal amount of screen time, but we follow Cliff more, starting and ending the movie with his career slumps and unappreciated friendship. His entire character had as much depth as a toilet bowl. Sure, he’s a good friend. Sure, he loves his dog. Sure, he’s willing to give his life away for Rick Dalton. Sure, he may have murdered his wife and got away with it (what even was that by the way? Should we not have followed up on that plot point somewhere throughout the movie?). Tarantino wrote Cliff with just enough human emotion to make him seem like a person, but not enough to ever make him seem like a compelling character.

Rick was exactly the same. He was afraid of getting old, of no longer being famous, of becoming irrelevant. But that was as far as his character depth went, that was all Tarantino wrote for him. ‘Eh, he’s got one solid human emotion that the audience will recognize, good enough’ Tarantino said and left it at that.

Sharon Tate hardly counts as a character, she’s a place holder for a pretty face and Quentin Tarantino’s foot fetish. Sharon gets one scene devoted to her character development’s when she goes to see her own movie in theaters and the majority of that scene was devoted to staring at her dirty feet as they took over the screen because of the camera angle Tarantino used. I’m upset over it and everyone else ought to be too.

The characters in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood were barely fleshed out. It was the bare minimum that needed to be done and once that was met, Tarantino added nothing else.

The same thing happened with the plot.

What was Tarantino going to make Once Upon a Time in Hollywood about? Was it about the Charles Manson cult? Was it about the murder of Sharon Tate? Was it about 1969 Hollywood? Was it about Rick and Cliff’s friendship?

Because if it was about the murder of Sharon Tate, I can think of a hundred better ways Tarantino could have done it. Same for the Manson cult. Same for old school Hollywood. Same for Rick and Cliff’s friendship.

The big central plot point was that Rick lived next door to Sharon Tate. That was it. That was what held the entire movie together. If you remove that one aspect from the film, then it becomes a movie about two men who are friends, brothers, more than brothers, and yet don’t really talk to each other. Don’t really know each other. And don’t really understand or even try to understand each other in any way, shape, or form.
Without Sharon Tate and the unwanted attention she derived from Charles Manson, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood would have been two men rapidly drifting apart as they realized that they weren’t that close to begin with.

With Sharon Tate and the unwanted attention she derived from Charles Manson, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is about two men rapidly drifting apart as they realized that they weren’t that close to begin with, with the added addition of a flamethrower and a guy getting his dick bit off by a pit bull.
Nothing happens in this movie.

The plot is that there is no plot. It’s essentially a high school history report on old school Hollywood, old school film making, and old school acting approaches, masquerading as a movie. It’s Tarantino taking everything that he’s obsessed with, Leonardo DiCaprio, the 60s era of Hollywood, feet, gruesome and bloody violence, and shoving it all into a movie that he’s trying to sell to us as a ‘good movie.’ Rather than just his own personal spank bank material.
The characters are one dimensional and flat, Sharon Tate, the only female lead is once again reduced to nothing other than a sex symbol (in this case feet), the plot is boring, and the finale of sudden violence and gore is fun, but not enough to make this movie good.

I don’t know about you, but I want more out of a movie than this. Which is why I’m so amazed that people raved about this movie, that it was nominated for so many awards and Brad Pitt was winning awards left to right..

I found it boring. At times gross (can we stop with the foot fetish please Tarantino?). And overall, not that great.

Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is overrated and I think anyone without a boner for Tarantino flicks can see that.",movies,1611622953,randomspawner,True,1,0,2021-01-25

Inception's atmosphere is unparalleled.,"Seriously. I've read many reviews about the film and they all say the same stuff, the movie is innovative but has plot holes blah blah, but no one ever mentions the atmosphere of the movie - and atmosphere is, in my humble opinion, the most important aspect of a film.

Skip to any moment of the film and you'll be greeted with a banging soundtrack that gives you the feel of mystery and coolness. I highly doubt there is more than 30 seconds of silence in the film in total. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, and especially not when the film's ost is the greatest, and may I add the most underrated ost in film history. 

For me, no movie can match the vibe I get from, say, the scenes where Cobb kills Saito's guards in the first dream, that I recently remembered how much I love. Btw I recently asked for films that give off similar vibes to those in the mentioned sequences, and while I did receive decent GENERAL ACTION FILM suggestions none really came close to the subtle and secret spy feel I got from inception, a sum of many perfect factors - and I say perfect because the atmosphere really is as good as it can be, in contrast of the film's logic which is, admittedly, imperfect - and that made me realize how unique Inception is, even beyond from it's highly innovative core idea.

I feel like most ""movie buffs"" are too hung up on the technicalities of films that they forget to feel the film. Like, if you could just let go of the ""Oh, Arthur is explaining dreams for so long"" stuff and just start to feel the film, you might just enjoy it a bit more. Boy I can't wait to see how many downvotes my humble opinion will get! it seems like people here are not very economic with their downvotes, as they seem to use it when confronted with the slightest sign of a disagreement. I commented that while john wick is a good movie it is more chaotic and not as subtle as Cobb's assassination scenes in Inception and many people seemed to get offended with that comment!

True Lies (1994) was too lame to be rad 🙄,"I really love me some Arnie movies. Been into them since I was a little boy and found my babysitter's Commando VHS. I love me some James Cameron too! You can't understate the impact of the cinema legend. So when I found out about True Lies, I was excited to see the two working together. Surely, the movie would ride the same standard of being thought provoking and a visual spectacle.

Instead I got a sniveling self-jerk to toxic masculinity.

Harry Tasker? Insecure. Fragile. Selfish. While it understandable that anybody in real life might be crushed to find out their wife is having an affair, maybe a super secret agent who seduces women on a whim, endangering entire missions isn't the person to be passing judgment. Maybe a government agent who does things way worse things than have a flirty relationship with a stranger shouldn't be having a mental breakdown because of a SUSPECTED occurrence?

Kidnapping your wife, throwing her into an interrogation room and barraging her with questions is incel behavior. Making her dance for you on some kind of power trip is Weinstein behavior. With Arnolds marriage falling apart and his daughter becoming uncontrollable, when does Tasker turn inwardly and ask himself if he could possibly be the problem? Never. For the worlds smartest and most dangerous spy, Henry Tasker is a weenie. He lives off the hype of his colleagues. His ego is overinflated and becomes absolutely flaccid when faced with a challenge that can't be shot at. Still, the movie ends on a happy note and everyone lives happily ever after. Wow.

Jamie Lee Curtis? Absolutely fucking fumbled by James Cameron. Here you have a character who is likable, well meaning, and a perfect stand in for the audience (average American who daydreams of excitement), and how is she utilized? She gets humiliated, she gets her titties out, and she dances for the male gaze. 

But really, the real cherry on top is the scene where JLC and Arnold are in a fire fight. A gun drops within her reach. Here is the character that is most relatable to the audience. Here is the character who grounds you after seeing Arnold blow up an Evil Villain's mansion. Finally she gets a chance at redeeming her mistakes and achieving her dream of being an actual spy. And what does James Cameron do when he has the chance of making her a character with substance? She drops the gun... whoopsie ha ha see how silly and quirky this woman is?? With the hotel scene teasing of JLC being more than meets the eye, this turn was immensely disappointing.

Its not for suspense. The dropped gun kills everyone anyway. It was  another reminder that badassery and action is for men only. Henry Tasker is number 1 always. He does what he wants and always comes out on top, as men should. /s

I wont say the movie wasn't influential. As an MGS fan I recognized the scuba stealth infiltration and harrier fight almost immediately. The action sets were fuckin crazy and there were a few good jokes in there. But the movie would've been better if it wasnt massaging the ego of toxic, controlling men everywhere who think violent tactics and emotional manipulation are viable methods of achieving what you want. Maybe it would've been better of Arnold just communicated with his wife and kid. Everything that happens in this movie is Arnold fault and the way he handles it only makes things worse. What a bummer James. Be better.",movies,1611626269,churroguapo,True,1,0,2021-01-25

"I'm interested to watch a movie called ""American Skin."" From the general audience it has fairly good reviews, while the critics give it terrible scores. Is this a movie worth the watch, or is it just a flop?","After watching the trailer, it seems like the movie tackles a serious topic that most shows and movies try to stay away from, especially in today's society.


Based on what a lot of critics had to say, they consider the movie to be nothing but pandering, romanticized violence, and sends the wrong message to its audience. While the general public seem to think that this movie sparks needed, yet uncomfortable conversations that are either never talked about or whitewashed for the sake of it being palatable for the general masses.


I figured that this subreddit would be a reliable place to see what the movie is like from a ""less"" biased perspective. I love movies, especially when they try to get across a point/idea. However, if they're not done right then it not only ruins the message they are trying to convey, but ruins the enjoyment of the film overall.


So, is this movie worth the watch? Any feedback would be really appreciated.",movies,1611442039,EmbodiedGuide7,True,1,11,2021-01-23

Infinity War and Endgame are not good movies,"For the record, I'm not just being an MCU hater, I think they do have some genuinely great movies like Iron Man, Black Panther, and Ragnarok 

However IW and Endgame, the two highest rated movies in the franchise, are extremely bloated Macguffin movies with many unnecessary scenes that do little to actually move the plot forward - lots of gratuitous action just for the sake it. The pacing in these movies is sloppy, the cohesion is tenuous, and the Russos are unskilled at inserting comedy into their movies, but they try so hard. They don't have the timing or a good sense of how to do comedic scenes and how to work with the actors on their delivery. 

They also didn't even try to add any sort of theme or substance to these movies. Obviously superhero movies aren't supposed to be deep, but at least some of them do a somewhat decent job at giving a baseline level of purpose to the movie. Iron Man touches on the military industrial complex, Ragnarok touches on nationalism and imperialism, Black Panther touches on the ideas of MLK vs Malcolm X...meanwhile IW and Endgame are extremely half baked about how they address....population control I guess? Why war is bad? There isn't any substance, it's just a 5 hour macguffin with endless action scenes. I will also add that Thanos' plan is incredibly stupid, and while Brolin was awesome in the role, they could have utilized this character much better. 

I get that the entire appeal of the Avengers movies is that they are giant crossover climax spectacle that is the culmination of 20+ movies....but they didn't deliver something that is timeless. Instead they just delivered fan service and endless VFX that you really had to experience in the moment in theaters to fully appreciate.

"I underestimated ""the night of the hunter"" (1955). It truly is as good as they say.","I've generally found that anything with a bit of a story attached to it is generally lauded too much, and isn't that amazing.

Think of the huge outpouring of love for kurt Cobain, and freddy mercury because of their tragic stories.

""The night of the hunter"" should really fit in that mold. 

Director that only ever made one film, and a good one at that. Had a more famous career in acting.
Underappreciated on release, and is better than what people thought at the time.

Seems like a perfect recipe for being too lauded because of its story.

So I put this lower down on my watch list and didn't bother seeing it for ages. That was my mistake, and I really shouldn't have assumed something like that.

Because this film really is Incredible. Not just good, not even just great. It's an incredible movie. 

The atmosphere, the cinematography, the villain. It's all truly fantastic. 

Out of the films from the 50s I've seen so far, this is easily one of the best. It hasn't seemed to have aged very much, like others have, and is genuinely pretty unnerving and almost scary at times. 

So in short. I'm an idiot. This film is amazing. Go watch it already.",movies,1611448157,insearchoflosttime-,True,1,10,2021-01-23

As a straight woman who is not into conventional porn at all but enjoys a good horny movie here and there, I was looking for a subreddit dedicated for sex scenes from movies and TV, and was greatly disappointed to find none. So, I wanted to come here and talk about erotic films.

What are the most erotic movies you've seen? Are there movies or spesific scenes that you find really erotic? Best sex scenes? I think that films that have sex as a major theme can be very erotic and have incredible sex scenes, like The Handmaiden (2016) and The Concubine (2012). I don't know why only Korean movies come to mind right now, but I feel like they really can do steamy scenes right.

I won't talk about it too much because I don't wanna spoil anything and most of the movie is based on the story more than anything else. But it's a great little teens movie, really funny and joyfull. It's great seeing such movie that cheers you up. Sincerely it really got me back on track for studying! Cause well, I'm no genius at all, but I'm bored as hell in university, and lockdown is just crunching the little motivation I've still have. So I really appreciate this movie for inspiring me!

For the little pitch, it's a university for genius kids and a new students arrives. He is put in charge of building a laser with other students, and especially one that is absolutely crazy but a freaking genius, and is played by Val Kilmer. He is absolutely excellent in this role! And the whole cast is great too! It's hard describing how much I enjoyed this movie, cause I think it's mainly nostalgia speaking and also the fact that I really identify with the protagonist.

Pacific Heights is a classic thriller in my opinion.,"Just put it on for the first time in decades, and man is it a story well told. It might be simple, but I really don't think they make them like that anymore. Lots of old movie style charm, everything set up pays off, and Melanie Griffith is really good in it, as well as Michael Keaton giving a menacing performance. 

Not to mention the score by Hans Zimmer is one of his best scores, before he went all Pirates Of The Caribbean (I love those scores too, but this was just so much simpler and aiding the movie).

Anyone seen it?

another Donnie Darko question,"not sure where else to ask this, hopefully someone can help me out here.

i understand that Frank is some kind of temporal ghost telling Donnie what to do in order to help him return the artifact. however, i’m not sure how half the things in the film help this goal. for example, we see Donnie burn down Cunningham’s home leading to the domino-like string of events resulting in his mother/sister being on the plane that he rips the artifact from; but that plane would be there regardless, nothing he did up to that point helped him achieved that goal. 

all Frank really needed to do was tell Donnie to read Sparrows book, and be there when the plane flies over at the end of the film; unless there’s something i’m overlooking here?",movies,1611457767,concrete_manu,True,1,7,2021-01-23

Looking for a movie trailer from around the 2000s,"I remember seeing a trailer for a movie when I was a kid and wanting to watch it but I never did. The trailer just popped back into my head about an hour ago and I’ve been trying to find the movie since. It’s proving to be very hard to find because I only remember a few things from the trailer. One of the things I remember is someone shouting the I’m the king of the world"" line from titanic then it immediately cuts to a kid saying the ""show me the money"" line from Jerry Maguire over the phone. I also remember a part where the kid says to a man something like ""how old are you?"" then the man said his age and the kid goes ""that is old"" with the camera zooming further in on his face after each word.

I know that I saw the trailer on a dvd for another movie. This means the movie I am looking for is probably a children’s maybe because it was likely being played before another children’s movie. I remember watching it around 2011 so it didn’t come out after then but I’m not sure how old the dvd was so I’m not sure when it came out exactly but it was probably in the 2000s area maybe late 90s at the earliest.

This is all I can remember right now if anyone knows what trailer or even better what movie I’m talking about I would like to know as I am descending into madness.

“I’m Thinking of Ending Things” this contains spoilers to the film SO FINISH WATCHING before we discuss!,"I believe people forget to mention why Lucy keeps egging on about the thoughts of ending this nonexistent relationship. If this is meant to be an idealized girlfriend, then there’d be no need for her to feel uneasy about moving on from Jake. That could mean two things: Jake originally planned to stop living in his own thoughts of the past and just face reality. Or: This movie is about Jake tragically facing the truth but having an inability to live on. 

The scene with Jake’s parents could represent his final goodbye’s with them. This entire interaction holds so many contradictions, but what I want to focus on is the mom mistaking Jake’s 20th birthday to be his 50th. Jake could’ve actually been there in the flesh or Jake couldn’t muster the perfect time to mentally leave his parents. The inconsistencies in Lucy’s telling of how they first met could support this too. After the runaround of a story, she mentions how Jake finally became a “normal” and “funny” person.. but that doesn’t sound like something Jake would be. Jake was working these ideas in real time because everything had to feel right to him. Then Lucy mentions how they’ve been together for only two weeks but feels as though it’s been far longer. Jake could’ve rehearsed this moment ,or at least the idea of having a girlfriend, for years on end, unable to perfect each sequence. 

Lucy comes to this realization and then plans to officially end things on the staircase. She offers the idea of wanting to “make a clean break” because “he could only wait for so long”. At this point, Lucy feels unaware of how much control she has over herself. She feels as if melded to Jake’s own self. Because that’s what she is, but it’s coming to a point where Jake couldn’t differentiate a false reality from what’s real. This is made concrete when Lucy sees a picture of Jake as a child. Lucy begins to question Jake’s past when she thinks “wasn’t it me?” It also shows how little Lucy has ever mentioned of her family or her own past, because she never used this to relate to Jake in any way besides not knowing who is who. The only person that was ever on her mind was just Jake. Jake is unable to establish a clear sense of character but he no longer cares. He just moves on to the next moment, seeking to find the finale of closing things off with his parents. 

Around the same time later, both Jake and Lucy begin to cry. Jake could’ve finally found reconcilement, even if it be abrupt and short, in departing from his family. For Lucy to cry with unannounced thoughts, that’s to tell the viewer how connected her and Jake truly are. Too much of Jake was seeping into the figment of what be Lucy.  

Moving on to the final scenes of the movie, Lucy would later on ask herself “how long would it take to die from hypothermia?” Which sort of foreshadowed Jake’s untimely death in the final scenes. Lucy would then chase after Jake and traverse through the school. Skipping the dialogue she holds with the janitor, a.k.a Jake talking to himself, she takes part in a dance. Jake ,the janitor, kills this false idea once and for all and then reacts in real time with heavy breaths as he gets ready and moves towards the car. Once inside, Jake puts the keys down and just sits until he goes mad. These are his final moments and he chose this car to be his burial ground. Cutting to the end credits, we see a bright sunny day and snow covering some of the frame. If any moment in this movie can relate to this, it’d be when the father sees the many paintings of Lucy’s. He mentions how could he “feel something, if there’s not a person feeling... sad or joyous”. Going by the father’s words, what am I to feel if there’s no person there? Well, there is. Jake is just hidden in plain sight, covered by the snow on the car. He died of the aforementioned hypothermia after finally cutting ties with his reminders of a false life.  Hence the double entendre in the name “I’m Thinking of Ending Things”.",movies,1611271014,RrenDre,True,1,0,2021-01-21

What movies do you expect to be made about the Trump era?,"So I was thinking of this now. I can't see an actual Trump biopic, liberals aren't going to want to be reminded of him and his supporters won't want to watch it unless it deifies him, which it obviously wouldn't. Although maybe HBO will make one like they did ""Recount"" and ""Game Change"" about him post-election and dealing with his defeat and failed attempts to overturn it, kind of like ""Downfall"" really.

Anyway what I expect:

* Lots of Covid movies. Probably mostly fictional stories set during Covid.
* The Capitol insurrection will probably get one. Possibly heavily fictionalized, but it's too much of a historical event to ignore now. Might make Eugene Goodman into the hero.
* The killing of George Floyd and aftermath. I actually discussed with some people about who could be villainous enough to play Derek Chauvin. Sounds like Best Supporting Actor bait.
* Charlottesville. I'm sure someone's writing a script on this already. Likely will be heavily fictionalized, but could easily fulfill an Oscar bait niche, anti-racism movie and based on actual events.
* The most likely figure I see to get a biopic is Dr. Anthony Fauci. Sounds like a potential Best Actor Oscar bait too (that's kind of the point of biopics!) although I'm not saying it'll be successful.",movies,1611273386,thedubiousstylus,True,1,35,2021-01-21

Has Stallone ever expressed interest in returning Rambo back to a more poignant story like we saw in First Blood?,"Stallone is no stranger to this. 2006's Rocky Balboa was a return to its roots and was a more heartfelt film. He also praised Creed for this too, and while Creed 2 felt a bit more cliche, it was ultimately successful in fleshing out previously one dimensional character of Drago. 

I was disappointed that Rambo 4 and 5 just seem to lean into the action tropes of the sequels. It would be interesting to have another Rambo film where perhaps Rambo becomes the police commissioner/sheriff of a small town (similar to what we saw in the original) and have it act as a commentary on police brutality, perhaps have the ""villain"" be an Iraq war vet gone rogue/mad. 

I just don't ser why he isn't interested in doing a more interesting take. I know that bad reviews do get him down, he made Rocky 6 because he felt bad leaving the franchise on Rocky 5. His time for a Rambo 6 is running out.",movies,1611274644,ThrowawayOgleks,True,1,14,2021-01-21

Why High School Movies Suck,"&amp;#x200B;

Like everyone on this subreddit, i love movies. I never understood why but thats always been my thing. Also like many, I knew I'd be in film before I knew what I wanted to do in it. I was like many of you, cluelessly watching movies without any understanding of it. Whatever looked funny, I would buy the ticket. When I finally gained access to R-rated movies, I would watch it and convince myself this is what mature people watch. All because it was R-Rated.

[\\""Yes this movie about a kid travelling miles on a road trip with his friends to lose his virginity. But its R rated so its gotta be good.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/9s8rsb1oxrc61.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cb2eff7c8e40091b58acb7c6811cd0084b106e1b)

The following statement may baffle a few of you, but I too went to a high school and never had any of these stories occur. And I watched so High school movies. Whenever a friend invited me to a party I would literally watch Dazed and Confused and convince myself I was going to have that same night.

I believed all these movies because it was a simple slice of life experience I could only dream to have. I was horribly anti-social, an obvious loner and too honest and dimwitted to not get bullied almost every day by people I called friends.

Then I was introduced to weed and it opened my eyes to everything. It was like the crop bashed open my door, stormed into my room and went, ""hey you dumb motherfucker you're still playing with toys at 16-years-old because you're obsessed with telling stories, you pointless fucking nincompoop!"" I'll admit my thoughts can be a little aggressive at times but by golly its right! I am a pointless nincompoop and I wanna work on not being that anymore."" So I dashed my raggedy anne doll to the floor ran to my parents' garbage PC to begin writing my ideas.

But what? I had no ideas and no true understanding of what goes into telling a good story. I would just mesh existing ideas together in my head and put a new spin on them.

Then I finally graduated and left that life behind forever to pursue filmmaking in Toronto. It was here a gained a social circle with common interests and a much better understanding of the craft. It was also here that I came up with my first original concept, it was a stoner rehashing of my high school experience where after being an anti-social embarrassment the protagonist falls into a popular circle just from the mention that he's smokes weed. It was really just scenes of a lame kid getting high with his friends and realizing theres no point to any of this. I know, jumps right off the page don't it. Makes it worst that I thought it'd be comedy gold to always have them high or drunk so they'd say ignorant stuff all the time. 

[\\""Who wouldn't find this hilarious!\\"" I thought.](https://preview.redd.it/hflvolsa0sc61.jpg?width=680&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da589c7c87c2c5b86027495b93cc3e5f0ba0e66d)

They tell you in school right out the gate that you can't just be a writer. Well, you could but you wouldn't be making enough money to justify it until you magically turn into Christopher Nolan and you're just amazing at everything you touch. That's the thing, you gain connections based on your commitment to working on other movies before you work on yours, if you'd like to of course. That's what I wanted to do. Still after 12 years working on my own stuff, more so now than ever before.

So I can't help but take offence sometimes when I see a new high school comedy come out and its choice of words in dialogue and plot-pushing is absolutely childish and really hard to watch. ""Why the hell are they all making the exact same mistakes???"" I would contemplate. Sometimes aloud to scare away the homeless on Subways. I knew on some level I was growing as an aspiring writer because I was developing more frustrations than I used to with films coming out. Like that one Michael Cera Kat Dennings movie Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist: the plot and intention is overall charming and something we can all relate to, but to push the plot forward it relies on the dogshit embarrassment of a drunk friend who becomes so drunk and such a problem that her friends literally have to chase her all the way around the city while a pointless B story goes on in the the background. No question if I was Kat Dennings by the hour mark I'd go, ""Alright let this selfish bitch get stabbed or whatever I don't care I came here to smash Michael Cera"" (and smash hard is what we would do). Honestly, it all got pretty pointless by the time this drunk girl drops her cellphone in a puke infested toilet just so the mindless chase can continue. ""Gold"", the writer must have thought .

&amp;#x200B;

[\\""But we're friends so I'm allowed to be a shitty person!\\""](https://preview.redd.it/yb7l6f8s0sc61.jpg?width=468&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcc5e492e543a1ebc864d5ab8e07eb1ef89436b4)

""Why the fuck did you even put that in the script?"" I've lately been very vocal about my frustrations with this snobby writing in film because I'm actually surprised no one else I know comes to these conclusions until they are brought up. This has made me look pretty inconsiderate at times and to those who have already taken offence I apologize. I just fucking love film and I hate seeing people waste big budget opportunities on something thats an issue just by looking at whats in the script. I mean come on, are people this afraid to question the integrity of the people green lighting these abominations that tear apart your belief in what you love. Then how about wait a few odd years before you get settled in the rich persons life. Im so sick of all of these movies that are just safe projects that reach for quantity over quality. I understand many streaming services have done a lot to try to limit this behaviour, but its still aggravating to see everyone shrug off essential details but bank so much on it at the same time. Or maybe they really don't and that's really the issue at hand. Not to say movies have to be 100% convincing, we all have it in us to forgive a few flaws because you liked everything else you saw. It feels like they're just trying to take advantage of that reasoning, don't you think?

We know the difference between a good movie and a bad movie, I hope we do at least. They should be no political divide. So when I hear someone utter the excuse, ""Oh its just for kids,"" I die a little inside. I understand kids can be snobby archaic little shits but it doesn't mean you should make stuff that better mask it. I'm thankful there are films out there that have justified these teen movies being pretty fucking smart when it y'know gives a shit about whats at hand.

A year ago I lived with this girl I knew and we were hanging out and having drinks with my brother. We decided to turn on a movie and one of the first on Netflix that came up was Mean Girls. An undeniable classic written by the funny and fabulous Tina Fey. Its a movie I undermined when I was little but as you watch it when you get older you go, ""holy shit that movie was the real deal."" My brother and I were set, except my roommate. And why was that, you ask? Because she hates high school movies for every single reason I stated earlier. So the producers of these crappy high school movies are basking in the thought that their audience are so stupid and they'll buy anything they make completely undermines the potential of the audience and the I feel the ones you do trick will one day resent you for it. So no surprise, we convinced her to give Mean Girls a go and low and behold she thought it was splendid. She literally said, ""Wow I never thought some of these teen movies can actually be pretty good.

[Honestly why people thought this film would be like every other teen film is lost on me.](https://preview.redd.it/zutix9yc1sc61.jpg?width=615&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32471e79c930259882bb44d50cf7761cd6b0519e)

I understand thats only one example but these excuses come up a lot. Plainly put, the people I want to make money from are good spirited intelligent people that feel comfortable investing two hours of their time to a movie thats an escape they can experience all the same. I don't recall there ever being a time when a moviegoer walks out of a film because it was too smart they just couldn't understand it. But how many times has a filmgoer stormed out of a theatre because it was an obvious piece of crap that the theatre tied a ribbon to and convinced you to pay $16.99 for a ticket. I still haven't forgotten that price, $16.99 for a ticket to a regular screening of 2019's Pet Semetary, an absolute horrendous piece of shit (I have a long lecture prepared for this one day if you'd like to read it).

So now that I've given you all my hate for high school movies, now let me share what I would do to fix it for the audience I hope to have one day, because somehow I still believe in them:

First I want to take out this attempt of making every narcissistic  teenager sound wittier than they actually are. This doesn't mean you have to make them sound dumb, believe me I still cringe when a high school kid on screen is forced by writers to utter something unintelligible. It's dishonest unoriginal fluff.

The biggest point I've been trying to tackle is how they portray bullying. They always try to take that opportunity and make them a brute antagonist that makes the viewers go, ""you're right, bullying IS wrong."" But the reality is bullying has an oddly good side too. Hardcore bullying isn't always centred around an aimless attack based on some aspect of you that you can't control. Some of the harshest times i've seen bullying commence or a fight go down because of bullying its something that could have been totally avoidable. In both the victim's and the bully's defence. The fact that bullies are always out to tackle your weaknesses makes writers want to turn them all into these idiot villains with bad parents so destined to one day be foiled by the protagonist, all to make victims of actual bullying happy. I've interacted with bullies that won't shut up about how deformed my penis is (I guess they caught a view of it one day when I wasn't looking, my fault) and I've also had bullies who did shitty things to prove a point that may have been a bust but ultimately went on to learn to be caring friends with a lot of regret to how they behaved in the past. I'll be honest, I learned a lot more from those ones and I think that idea deserves more screen time.

I know high school is super obvious and cliche. But I want to try to tell the tales that we just aren't used to. Yes, those stories are still out there. No, not everything has been done. Stop siding with the shithole filmmakers that try to make that belief their career and if you really believe it then please get the fuck out of the business and let someone who cares try (I'm looking at you, Star Wars movie makers). Eighth Grade is a good example, It went deep into the life of an eighth grade girl struggling with her image while growing up in this toxic digital age that has a done a huge number on generations to come. Bo Burnham had a fresh way to tell a new teen school movie we can all appreciate the same way. If you haven't seen it, I recommend it. The Edge of Seventeen, another great example: a film starring the dazzling Hailee Steinfeld and Woody Harrelson. Its literally about a bratty girl who implodes on her angel of a best friend and her older brother when she finds out they fell in love. She goes around embarrassing her mom and fighting with her brother while seeking advice from her favourite teacher (Harrelson). Just talking about it makes it hard for people to understand why I like it. But I'm being serious when I say I would watch it again, and I have. You can't always explain why, but you can just tell when people care about making a real movie. Actors and crew put their fucking backs into these ones when all the expected weight was against them, and I say cudos to all in making those movies as well as those who continue to fight to make good films.

Why High School Movies Suck,"Like everyone on this subreddit, i love movies. I never understood why but thats always been my thing. Also like many, I knew I'd be in film before I knew what I wanted to do in it. I was like many of you, cluelessly watching movies without any understanding of it. Whatever looked funny, I would buy the ticket. When I finally gained access to R-rated movies, I would watch it and convince myself this is what mature people watch. All because it was R-Rated.

*Processing img jtt06d3p4sc61...*

The following statement may baffle a few of you, but I too went to a high school and never had any of these stories occur. And I watched so High school movies. Whenever a friend invited me to a party I would literally watch Dazed and Confused and convince myself I was going to have that same night.

I believed all these movies because it was a simple slice of life experience I could only dream to have. I was horribly anti-social, an obvious loner and too honest and dimwitted to not get bullied almost every day by people I called friends.

Then I was introduced to weed and it opened my eyes to everything. It was like the crop bashed open my door, stormed into my room and went, ""hey you dumb motherfucker you're still playing with toys at 16-years-old because you're obsessed with telling stories, you pointless fucking nincompoop!"" I'll admit my thoughts can be a little aggressive at times but by golly its right! I am a pointless nincompoop and I wanna work on not being that anymore."" So I dashed my raggedy anne doll to the floor ran to my parents' garbage PC to begin writing my ideas.

But what? I had no ideas and no true understanding of what goes into telling a good story. I would just mesh existing ideas together in my head and put a new spin on them.

Then I finally graduated and left that life behind forever to pursue filmmaking in Toronto. It was here a gained a social circle with common interests and a much better understanding of the craft. It was also here that I came up with my first original concept, it was a stoner rehashing of my high school experience where after being an anti-social embarrassment the protagonist falls into a popular circle just from the mention that he's smokes weed. It was really just scenes of a lame kid getting high with his friends and realizing theres no point to any of this. I know, jumps right off the page don't it. Makes it worst that I thought it'd be comedy gold to always have them high or drunk so they'd say ignorant stuff all the time.

*Processing img 7q5rusur4sc61...*

They tell you in school right out the gate that you can't just be a writer. Well, you could but you wouldn't be making enough money to justify it until you magically turn into Christopher Nolan and you're just amazing at everything you touch. That's the thing, you gain connections based on your commitment to working on other movies before you work on yours, if you'd like to of course. That's what I wanted to do. Still after 12 years working on my own stuff, more so now than ever before.

So I can't help but take offence sometimes when I see a new high school comedy come out and its choice of words in dialogue and plot-pushing is absolutely childish and really hard to watch. ""Why the hell are they all making the exact same mistakes???"" I would contemplate. Sometimes aloud to scare away the homeless on Subways. I knew on some level I was growing as an aspiring writer because I was developing more frustrations than I used to with films coming out. Like that one Michael Cera Kat Dennings movie Nick &amp; Norah's Infinite Playlist: the plot and intention is overall charming and something we can all relate to, but to push the plot forward it relies on the dogshit embarrassment of a drunk friend who becomes so drunk and such a problem that her friends literally have to chase her all the way around the city while a pointless B story goes on in the the background. No question if I was Kat Dennings by the hour mark I'd go, ""Alright let this selfish bitch get stabbed or whatever I don't care I came here to smash Michael Cera"" (and smash hard is what we would do). Honestly, it all got pretty pointless by the time this drunk girl drops her cellphone in a puke infested toilet just so the mindless chase can continue. ""Gold"", the writer must have thought .

*Processing img 8ewxns7w4sc61...*

""Why the fuck did you even put that in the script?"" I've lately been very vocal about my frustrations with this snobby writing in film because I'm actually surprised no one else I know comes to these conclusions until they are brought up. This has made me look pretty inconsiderate at times and to those who have already taken offence I apologize. I just fucking love film and I hate seeing people waste big budget opportunities on something thats an issue just by looking at whats in the script. I mean come on, are people this afraid to question the integrity of the people green lighting these abominations that tear apart your belief in what you love. Then how about wait a few odd years before you get settled in the rich persons life. Im so sick of all of these movies that are just safe projects that reach for quantity over quality. I understand many streaming services have done a lot to try to limit this behaviour, but its still aggravating to see everyone shrug off essential details but bank so much on it at the same time. Or maybe they really don't and that's really the issue at hand. Not to say movies have to be 100% convincing, we all have it in us to forgive a few flaws because you liked everything else you saw. It feels like they're just trying to take advantage of that reasoning, don't you think?

We know the difference between a good movie and a bad movie, I hope we do at least. They should be no political divide. So when I hear someone utter the excuse, ""Oh its just for kids,"" I die a little inside. I understand kids can be snobby archaic little shits but it doesn't mean you should make stuff that better mask it. I'm thankful there are films out there that have justified these teen movies being pretty fucking smart when it y'know gives a shit about whats at hand.

A year ago I lived with this girl I knew and we were hanging out and having drinks with my brother. We decided to turn on a movie and one of the first on Netflix that came up was Mean Girls. An undeniable classic written by the funny and fabulous Tina Fey. Its a movie I undermined when I was little but as you watch it when you get older you go, ""holy shit that movie was the real deal."" My brother and I were set, except my roommate. And why was that, you ask? Because she hates high school movies for every single reason I stated earlier. So the producers of these crappy high school movies are basking in the thought that their audience are so stupid and they'll buy anything they make completely undermines the potential of the audience and the I feel the ones you do trick will one day resent you for it. So no surprise, we convinced her to give Mean Girls a go and low and behold she thought it was splendid. She literally said, ""Wow I never thought some of these teen movies can actually be pretty good.

*Processing img uhnnu1m15sc61...*

I understand thats only one example but these excuses come up a lot. Plainly put, the people I want to make money from are good spirited intelligent people that feel comfortable investing two hours of their time to a movie thats an escape they can experience all the same. I don't recall there ever being a time when a moviegoer walks out of a film because it was too smart they just couldn't understand it. But how many times has a filmgoer stormed out of a theatre because it was an obvious piece of crap that the theatre tied a ribbon to and convinced you to pay $16.99 for a ticket. I still haven't forgotten that price, $16.99 for a ticket to a regular screening of 2019's Pet Semetary, an absolute horrendous piece of shit (I have a long lecture prepared for this one day if you'd like to read it).

So now that I've given you all my hate for high school movies, now let me share what I would do to fix it for the audience I hope to have one day, because somehow I still believe in them:

First I want to take out this attempt of making every narcissistic teenager sound wittier than they actually are. This doesn't mean you have to make them sound dumb, believe me I still cringe when a high school kid on screen is forced by writers to utter something unintelligible. It's dishonest unoriginal fluff. Leave it alone and get back to the plot.

Why does Reddit hate Black Panther so much?,"There’s been a lot of anti-Black Panther commenting going on this subreddit and reddit in general. I’m really curious as to why people hate it and call it a bad movie? I’m not a fan of Superhero movies. I enjoy the comics, but the movies are always so cheesy and formulaic to me. Black Panther was a breath of fresh air. It was a film that was structured like an African Play (drawing on inspiration from the Lion King play), it gave a new cultural perspective on the Superhero movie genre, and it had a compelling Protagonist and Antagonist dynamic. As a Black Male, I think the film did an excellent job of representing our culture. From the Hip Hop culture presented in Oakland, to the African imagery in Wakanda. It’s a very relatable film for me. I think it’s also a very accessible film for those who aren’t privy to Black Culture. It’s a very socially conscious and relevant take on a Superhero film.

I’m not saying the movie is perfect. I think that it’s overhyped to a certain degree. I DO NOT THINK IT DESERVES A BEST PICTURE NOMINATION AT ALL. The CGI is bad in some cases, the movie is predictable at times, the characterization is poor on the Wakandan side. I think it’s a good movie with flaws. However, the notion that it’s terrible is unreasonable. The hate I’ve seen in this subreddit comes from people who are trying to counter the hype, and in some cases it comes from those who want to downplay the film’s success because it’s targeted towards the black culture.

"Yes, Jurassic Park is a great movie. But the best thing about it was watching it with my dad.","I first heard of *Jurassic Park* from my dad. I’d never seen him so excited about a book before and I’ve never seen him so excited about a piece of content since. So, to my knowledge, 1990 is the year my dad’s pop-cultural life peaked (Between that and not going to a movie theater since *LA Confidential*, the 90s were a big decade for my dad.)

In one of my earliest memories, my dad comes bounding down the stairs, sits at the breakfast table, and immediately regales the rest of the family about the **Most Amazing Book** he just read. It was so good, he couldn’t put it down. He’d stayed up all night and read the entire thing. It was called *Jurassic Park*, and it was about the most clever idea: They took the blood out of mosquitos preserved in amber, and used it to clone dinosaurs. 

Now, that was a great hook, but what really sold me on the book was my dad’s enthusiasm. He is not normally an exuberant guy, but he was *into* this. I was down to check it out, but there was just one problem: I was 6-years-old. Granted, I was an avid reader, but I probably wasn’t up to a book like that yet. Fortunately, a solution was found: My dad read it to me. For the next week, he read it out loud to me every night before I went to bed. It was fucking awesome.

Cut to three years later.

My dad had just taken me to some crappy movie at the Fresh Pond theater in Cambridge. The kind of thing he’d never see anymore (remember: *LA Confidential*). He went off to hit the bathroom, I milled around in the lobby, and that’s when I saw it. The best logo ever. The single greatest piece of film-related branding in history. The poster that launched my life-long obsession with Hollywood advertising. The poster advertising the movie adaptation of *Jurassic Park*.

And I’ll say it: “A movie 65 million years in the making”? A tagline yet to be topped.

Anyway, I was stoked as shit. The movie is set to come out in early June 1993. A week before it’s set to premiere, I get a surprise: My dad has already bought tickets to the film. Not only that, he bought tickets to the *sneak preview*, midnight screening the night before the official premiere. As a fifth-grader, getting to stay up after midnight to go see a movie—on a school night, no less—was a big deal. I bragged about it for weeks. For months afterward, whenever I talked about seeing the movie, I slipped in the date that I saw it so that people could work out that I’d seen it a day early. (As if anybody cared.) 

The viewing experience was something else, still one of my all-time best movie-going experiences. I could wax rhapsodic about *Jurassic Park* all day long, but I’ll limit myself to calling out just a handful of highlights. As a fan of the book, I was most excited to see my favorite character, Ian Malcolm, brought to life. Jeff Goldblum did not disappoint, and I was surprised and thrilled by the change from book to movie that saw him surviving the island. And as a fan of velociraptors, boy oh boy did I love their portrayal in the movie. The danger they posed is set up so exquisitely at the start, and the climactic scene in the kitchen remains one of my all-time faves.

The thing is, though, every one in my generation can do this. We can all quote the entire film. We all remember the T-Rex scene. All of us know the trivia tidbit that the movie and book flip all the secondary character survivors and deaths. I even have a friend who walked down the aisle to the score at her wedding. (And for the record, it was elegant as hell. John Williams should be the official bridal march from now on.) But for me, as much as the movie holds a special place in my heart as a dope-ass movie (and it *is* a dope-ass movie), its singular place in my personal pantheon is because of the experience of seeing it with my dad.",movies,1611099144,musicmoviesandhoops,True,4,55,2021-01-19

Yes, some elements were convoluted and fuzzy, and dialogues contrived, but the movie was overall favorable.

What movie takes you back? aka how homeschooling my daughter brought Tall Tale (1995) back into my life.,"Tall Tale isn't the greatest movie ever made, but no one is claiming it is. What I can claim is that it was one of my favorites as a child of the 90s and re-watching it today with my daughter brought me some nostalgia feels. She is homeschooling, because Covid, so to make it fun my wife wanted to bring in some of the classic American Tall Tales. Yesterday she read her the story of Pecos Bill and my mind immediately went to this movie and sure enough it was on Disney+ so after dinner I threw it on for her to check out. 

I was struck immediately by the score. It is crazy how music and pull you back in time. It was like I was Ego from Ratatouille being pulled back to sitting in the floor of my childhood home, my back against the couch and a yellow Capri-Sun straw in my mouth like a piece of hay. It isn't anything special in the history of cinema, just a boisterous, sweeping classic western theme, but as a kid it was something I loved to hear. My dad was a fan of John Wayne movies but those aren't normally going to keep a kids attention, so this was the first time I had really paid attention to that classic, American western theme. 

Patrick Swayze goes to his Texas roots to pull of Pecos Bill. Scott Glenn scared the shit out of 6 year old me as the movies villain. I also completely forgot that Catharine O'Hare was in this movie, and just amazes me to know she was a part of my childhood from Beetlejuice, Home Alone to Tall Tale and as I grew up Best in Show and going back and seeing her in her earlier works and just recently in Schitt's Creek. She has had a great career spanning decades and genres. One thing that hit me like a ton of bricks is that John Henry ISN'T PLAYED BY MICHAEL CLARKE DUNCAN! This has to be a Mandela effect of some sort. 

Again the movie isn't perfect, it is fairly sitting at 50% on RT for both Critics and Audiences. I just wanted to share my moment of nostalgia at what was in my 6 year old mind a masterpiece deserving of running a VHS into the ground with rewatches.

Which country (besides the u.s) has had the best cinematic output throughout history?,"Basically, which country is no.2 compared to America in terms of cinema. 

This isn't meant to be looking at the present, but at all of cinema's history. So the golden ages of every country will be taken into consideration. 

Personally, I can't pick between them, so I'll just narrow it down to a few notable countries.

I think Japan gets a strong mention. 1950s and 1960s for them were incredible, and they had some great films in the other decades before and after 

I think Russia also gets one. Can't pick a certain decade, but they've had a pretty strong output overall.

Germany was fantastic during the 20s and 30s, but kind of tanked after that. So I'm not sure how to place them.

France was very prominent during the very beginning of cinema, and also have had french new wave, and just had some amazing films thought the years.

Britain has always been pretty decent, but I'm not sure they've ever been on top. Hitchcock is the most notable, but plenty of others have made some great films over the years. 

What country do you personally think has done the best? 

If I was held at gunpoint I'd probably say Japan, but it's too hard for me to confidently pick",movies,1611101515,a_reasonable_thought,True,0,72,2021-01-19

The Platform (2019) is one of the best films Netflix has ever put out,"The cinematography is beautifully traumatic, the concept is gut wrenchingly surreal, and the message is nowhere to be found unless you truly think about it. 

I’ll be honest, going in, I wasn’t sure what to expect. A vertical prison where a platform of food descends an indeterminate amount of floors seems like an odd story to tell, but when it’s told, it blends together almost seamlessly. The director had a story to tell and while he did, he created such a beautifully confusing picture that I almost didn’t want it to end.

I have only just seen it, but I already want to watch it again and again. I don’t understand the nuances wholly, though I think that’s the entire point.

That being said, EVERY one of Tarantino’s films are cinematic perfection in their own way. With that kind of a high standard of a collection it’s easy for me to say that One upon a time is my least favorite. I think it’s because this movie seemed almost like a parody of a QT movie to me. Kind of like how the last season of GOT was. It felt like there was more of an underlying sense of “well this is a Tarantino film so it has to have ______ “. All of his other films gave me a feeling like they had their own personality where as OUATIH felt like a cash grab by the master himself.

Does Satire really work anymore?," Movie Satires use humor to be critical of something and make some sort of point or advocate for change, we all know this. But in this day an age, does it really work anymore or did it ever work to begin with.

Now I love satire, I always have and I always will and like other who watch it, it becomes rewarding once you realize it is a satire and the subject matter it's trying convey. But Let's be honest. Satire is really fucking hard. It's why everyone just calls things satire and shrugs them off. Satire is so rarely carried out in an effective manner that we all just assume that satire is this really broad thing that encompasses everything from fart jokes to black comedy.

Many casual audiences don't know when there watching a satire and thus the message can end up going over their heads. Lindsey ellis made and interesting video that talked about this. Movies Like Blazing Saddles is one of the most on the nose anti-racist films you'll find yet it seems to be also be beloved by those with racist views,  Which group does America history X criticize the most?: Neo-Nazis, which groups loves america history  X the most?: Neo Nazis. Borat, a hilarious satire that exposes the backwards views of a lot of Americans ended up being loved by said Americans who found the character compelling because he was ""saying it as is"". Kubrick faced a similar issue with the reception to A Clockwork Orange. Fight Club keeps getting misinterpreted to this day. Not to mention a film like Wolf of wall street that even has a scene in the end on how audiences will misrepresent the message. 

Now an artist has no responsibility to the audience. Their only responsibility is to to their vision and their craft.  Satire is fundamental to our western culture, from political cartoons to stand-up comedy. It's a type of wisdom that gets us to the meat of an issue. We have it because someone took the time to make it.

But there is a problem with directors who don't really know what the subject is about. They keep creating heroes out of monsters because monsters are compelling. They keep ""Pain and Gaining"" it. And even when the film turns around and says, ""By the way, these guys are assholes and don't do anything they're doing,"" it's usually too late because they've already told a completely different story.

Not to mention how making comedies out of serious issues may make audiences not take it seriously. Media doesn't turn someone into a bad person (like how violent games don't make violent gamers, science has proved that multiple times), but what it can do is reinforce harmful beliefs, It's why Movies and TV has been the best use for propaganda over a century.

We live  as part of a society and are influenced on a daily basis by a ton of stimuli. We can't escape influence in all forms, and especially from artistic sources which throughout history has had profound impacts on shaping human culture.

I'm not saying I want satire to go away because I really don't want it too. But how does it work in this day an age as more people are uneducated on certain issue? One thing I'd like to see is more Satires that are less comedic( yes despite what many believe, satire isn't just comedy, this is what differentiate it from Parody), as it can have greater impact when it want to get serious or Movies that can be both comedic when it want to but serious when it needs to,  Parasite and Jo Jo rabbit are examples.

Still, marketing actual satire is hard because it inevitably alienates part of the audience. And that means not making money. Safer to just invite the audience to a display of excess and say, ""Can you believe it."" That puts butts in the seat.",movies,1611105087,Donna201299,True,0,30,2021-01-19

Was Joan Crawford really that selfish as depicted in 'Mommie Dearest'?,"Came across the 1981 'Mommie Dearest' playing on a TV channel. It was based on a memoir by Crawford's adopted daughter, Christina, but it features Joan as having narcissistic characteristics. I cannot get through the scenes where she abuses her daughter Christina, especially when she cuts the little girl's hair while she plays with her mother's makeup. 

She really loses when the studio-head of MGM tells her to leave as she's been labeled ""box-office poison"" as many movies she has starred in lost money. It's really hard to watch this as I would rather say mean words to Joan for being a ""terrible mother"" and a very ""selfish woman"". 

Now, I know that it's drama, but was Joan really that terrible in real life? Faye Dunaway really overdid it in depicting a narcissist.",movies,1611105463,PlutoGB08,True,3,21,2021-01-19

"Watching movies I have seen before, but I was only paying half attention to.","I had a job for over 20 years, that was stressful, required I worked long hours and travel a lot. When I was off, I rented new released movies or went to movie theaters, but I probably only paid attention to or retained about 1/4th of what happened in the movie. I was either thinking about what happened that day or what needed to happen the next day or upcoming days. I might also have an adult beverage or two.

So now that I have a lot more time, I'm an watching movies from this period in my life, but it's basically like watching new movies. For example, I'm watching ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" right now. Even though I saw this movie about 1 or maybe even 2 times, about 17 years ago, I don't remember almost everything I'm seeing. It's the same for movies like ""Dead Man Walking"", ""Poetic Justice"" and ""The Doors"". It's good because it's like I'm seeing great movies for the first time, but kind of sad because I didn't enjoy life and take in these movies years ago.

How do you feel about Skyfall being a blatant ripoff of The Dark Knight?,"I think it’s a great movie but i also think it rips off The Dark Knight on multiple aspects.

Javier Bardem with his weird lip movements. The Joker-esque messages sent to M and crew like “Think on your sins” His character pretending to be caught just like Joker. His nowhere nearly as good monologue about his abused origins blatantly ripping off Heath Ledger’s Joker even though he changed his story. Just the fact he’s basically supposed to be the Joker to Bonds Batman pisses me off. 

I think Sam Mendes is the discount Chris Nolan when he tries to compete with him. Personally I think American Beauty is one of the greatest movies ever made...but currently, with 1917, which is a direct “Let me show you my version of Dunkirk”....even though it’s so godamn boring and nowhere near the energy or tension inducing sensory experience that is Dunkirk.

My Top Five Coen Brothers movies... as of 2021,"Full transparency, my favorite director is Kubrick. But, that's why I wanted to make a list of my favorite Coen brothers movies. Because I don't give them enough credit. Also, full transparency, I'm drunk!

1. The Big Lebowski. My favorite genre is comedy, so naturally, their best comedy comes at number one for me.
2. *Inside Llewyn Davis. I love the sixties, and I love this movie's main character. He's a folk singer, anti-hero.*
3. No Country for Old Men. One scene in this movie gave me a nightmare, and I was over 21 years old. It was that scene when Anton kills Carson Wells.
4. Barton Fink. It's about a playwright/screenwriter. Full transparency, I... have a deep appreciation for the craft of screenwriting.
5. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. And yes, I wanted to throw a wrench into the cogs with this pick. It's because it's so off-beat, it's so original, and it's so experimental. The whole movie is just a handful, plus-one, of Western vignettes about the deep, uncertain, scary truths, of growing up, and surviving, in America's frontier times. It's so good. I don't know how many people have seen,  and appreciated this one, but I think it's a worthy number five.

"The Invention of Lying is overall not a good film, but it had some potential (Spoiler)","Unfortunately, it's first mistake was in combining heavy negative tones with little in terms of detail and payoff to warrant it. The film overall is very negative in tone, for humor's sake perhaps. The ""happy ending"" does feel forced and a lie. It is a depressing film when watched with a keen eye.

The alternate reality it creates seems far more implausible than believable. Feels like it was created simply to show off the protagonist's invention of the lie. It fails to come across as truthful or analytical, largely it lacks faithful worldbuilding to make this universe believable for the main premise of ""if nobody told lies, then many many people would live terrible depressed lives"". Simply not true. If the film wanted to make a more believable world, all it would have to do is give more people than just ricky gervais, the ability to have deep compassion or deep thought. It appears that only the protagonist can have deep thought. 

And as such if only the protagonist has deep thought, then he comes across as smart in a ""dumb"" world.

That is my main gripe with the film. Someone else did an overblown analysis of the film which got more things right but also got some things a bit muddled.

Overall I would have loved if the film was a lot better with worldbuilding, characters etc because the basic idea and title of the film was appealing and nifty yet it fails to properly explain key details and lacks any authenticity in it's worldbuilding, so comes across as one writer's angst-filled delusional dream. overall, the film is almost a chore to watch with how it's executed.

I watched it in my college film class so I’m pretty sure it’s some kind of classic but I don’t know how popular. I tried to track the syllabus or professor down but I can’t. It’s a black in white movie that involves a murder and a trial but that’s not all of the movie or even the main focus I think. It’s just most of what I remember. I’m pretty sure there was a woman who killed someone and the trial was an attempt to prove it. I think the body was in some small shack by a lake or ocean. I can picture parts of the movie vividly but not much. Also I think I also remember that they were pretty wealthy and had a big house or maybe she worked for a wealthy lady in a big house and killer her. I think it was around the 30s or 40s maybe.

"Why do people get so upset and downvote whenever someone mentions movie theaters never being the same again? I get it’s a touchy subject for many, but acting as if this isn’t a possibility at this point is not a good way of thinking.","*Not attacking anyone, just stating my opinion and experiences*. 

As the title states, every time I’ve mentioned movie theaters never being the same again, people get upset or downvote posts/comments. This applies to real life and the internet. 

Now this isn’t always the case, as we all have different experiences. But for me, it’s like people are in this dream like state where everything is just going to bounce back to normal as if nothing ever happened. 

In 2020, things were still unfolding, so I understand why we all thought everything would bounce back. We didn’t fully understand how serious things were getting until it blew up in everyone’s faces around March. However, we’re in 2021 now. We know what’s going on, now we’re focused on how we’re going to move forward. 

The reality is...theaters will never be the same. Just as other parts of our society will never be the same. 

YES, we will probably be able to crowd into theaters again in the future. However, it’s just not going to be like it was during let’s say...Endgame. 

The reality is...there’s going to be huge changes in guidelines and there’s going to be massive changes to how theaters operate going forward. We’re seeing it now, so it’s not far fetched to think in 2022 they’ll probably introduce even more precautions to make the experience safer for everyone. 

The reality is...theaters aren’t coming out of this pandemic untouched. Some will close, some will be fine. I mean, AMC was struggling for a while...and on top of that mom and pop theaters will definitely have a hard time after the pandemic. 

I don’t know why people get so upset whenever someone mentions this. 

I posted a few months ago about this, and all my posts got downvoted to oblivion and people were saying I was dumb. 

A few days ago I posted on the Marvel Studios sub, and despite majority of people agreeing with me, I had hella comments just acting as if everything will be normal by next year. 

Even in real life, it’s like people act like theaters will be open by next year and we’ll all be packed into the theaters watching movies again. Then when you bring up the possibility of changes being made, some people are completely in denial. 

And I want to emphasize this before people get angry with me. 
*
I’m NOT saying we can’t be optimistic and expect to be back in theaters. I practically lived at the theaters, so I’m very optimistic. However, to say that we’re just going to bounce back overnight and theaters will recover so easily is a very dangerous way of thinking. ***

Maybe it’s just me. But I’ve seen Youtubers get criticized for saying similar things that I’m saying, so it must not be just a random thing. 

While I think we WILL be going back to theaters, to say that everything will go back to normal so soon or even at all is kind of scary tbh, considering the massive shift we saw in 2020.",movies,1610927242,VibeMeThere,True,1,5,2021-01-17

Which actors deserves/deserved more recognition then they are getting?,"I find that a lot of great actors are underrated because of some poor movie choices or just because they have been in too many ""mainstream movies"".

Some of my picks are:

Tom Cruise - He gets a bad rep because of his eccentric personality and that people think he is a very one-dimensional actor. But I would say that no one plays a better ""action hero"" than he does. He was hilarious in Tropic Thunder and I am excited to see him in Rock of Ages

Nicholas Cage - He is incredibly talented and versatile, yet he has really ruined his image. Sure he has been in some terrible movies with some horrendous scripts, but if you focus on his gems you can really appreciate his talent. I don't get why he leads in so many action movies, because i feel that is his least suited role. My personal favorites of his are* Adaptation* and Matchstick Men",movies,1610927462,hootin_tootin,True,1,64,2021-01-17

Tenet is ridiculous,"Tenet was pretty ruined as I understood the plot holes. Do you agree with the following?

First, entropy reversed doesn't equal time reversed. A pool of water collecting itself into a vase doesn't travel backwards in time, it just has a weird movement forward in time. So reverting an object's behavior does not make it travel into the past, it just has a very weird way of going into the future (walking backwards etc.). Of course, if All the world reversed, it would be as if time went backwards (although it wouldn't, but only rewind into the future, but no matter). However, if it was only a specific object (eg the main character) it would revert its own behavior (rewind forwards) which is not what happened to the characters - they felt like time was going forward (and everything else backward). To explain, what would really happen is that their bodily movements should have followed their thoughts, e.g. the decision of moving a hand would come after moving it. That is just a weird way of going into the future (rewinding), because the world keeps going like normal (ie toward the future). No agency is left, you are just rewinding yourself.

Second, it should therefore be impossible to revert entropies (without complete nonsense) for a single person. Because while my behavior rewinds, the world does not. Let us say that we rewind/reverse starting from time T0, and right before that (T-1) I had gotten a coca cola. 
Therefore, when the I revert, I will be trying to drink the cola backwards (reverted) (T+1). However, if the world does not rewind, the cola is if course already gone when I try to drink it again (T+1). The world doesn't care that my molecules start reversing. If revert d spilled water starts to pool itself together and try to recollect itself in a vase, but you then quickly grab the vase, it won't be able to replay the past (i.e. rewind). Conclusively, only the entire world could revert without error. 

Third, let us just suppose that the characters could travel into the past (which would require rewinding the entire world - that would at least look like a rewinding time travel - not the opposite, reverting only one object. But let us just assume it) and also that they would experience, not reverse their own bodily movements. That is, let us assume the film's general theory. Now a relevant question is: Will the influenced past be the same as the already lived past of the time traveling characters? The film sadly contradicts itself here. Let us look at first the Freeport scene and then show how it contradicts the later boat scene /death of Sato.
In the freeport (art vaults), in the beginning of the film, the protagonist fights himself (ie a future version of himself who had time travelled back to the freeport to fight his previous self). And of course later the exact same thing happens, only now we follow the perspective of the time traveling version of the protagonist. In these two scenes, the same happens. So when you experience something (eg first version of the fight) which will latter be influenced by time travellers, it will be experienced as influenced by the time travellers right off the bat. It is not as if the protagonist in the freeport never fought anyone, but that a new version of the past was later created when he time travelled back to it later to fight himself. So, the past always already includes any time travelled influence. 
However, a contradictory take on time traveling shows itself in the boat scene / Sato's death. In the movie, before any time traveling to this scene has happened, Catherine has originally experienced a boat ride where she saw a girl jump off the boat. In this original situation, Sato is not killed (how could he be in the following events / the movie otherwise? And of course, Cathrin did not experience Sato's death originally.) However, when time traveling back to this situation, Cathrin alters the events (killing Sato). So when first experiencing the situation, the influence of time travelers was not included, and when they did time travel, they therefore made an alternate past. This is in complete contradiction with the freeport take on time traveling.

Fourth, let us again assume that time traveling for one object / person is possible, as they show it in the film. Then the person reverting time reverts at the same speed they usually live, only reverts. How can Neil then come from far in the future and still be young?

Fifth, what do the characters do after having travelled to the past, since they now are doublegangers. They can't do anything (except kill their past selves in order to take their self). This is pretty ridiculous.

As you can see, the whole movie is nonsensical. Disappointing.",movies,1610928875,cwhthemeister,True,1,32,2021-01-17

"Dog Day Afternoon, Cigarette scene","I had previously known that John Cazele died after exploding into hollywood with masterpiece after masterpiece and then dying. I believe I discovered this years ago after watching The Deer hunter and being like ""Why is Fredo in so many Oscar movies and then he just disappears?"" Between seeing Dog Day Afternoon previously, I didn't realize the death was of lung cancer (seems like a lot of greats died this way).

Watching today, the scene in which he lectures the teller about smoking really stood out now. I know there was improvisation on this film, so I'm wondering if 1. John already knew about his lung cancer, and 2. If this scene was improvised. I can't find anything about it online, which is surprising.

On another note, he didn't really have the typical Hollywood look, but who can imaging anyone else saying ""I'M SMART!"" It ranks up there with ""But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters,"" in terms of great and somewhat cringe inducing lines.

The films of Sean Baker,"Sean Baker is one of my favorite directors working today and I am anticipating his upcoming film Red Rocket, so I want to dig deep into his previous entries. Baker is a very humanist filmmaker who tell very realistic stories about underrepresented parts of America.

**Starlet (2011)**

Starlet chronicles a young woman's unexpected friendship with an old lady. Baker masterfully depicted two polar opposite worlds that initially connected via the randomness of fate, and eventually interlocked thanks to the ultimate goodness of humanity.

**Tangerine (2015)**

Baker filmed this on an iPhone to chronicle the life of two sex workers in Los Angeles. Storytelling at its best and the camera is doing all this crazy and wild shit. Super inspiring. Incredible performances. Made Los Angeles look so fucking cool too.

**The Florida Project (2017)**

I think this film is Baker's masterpiece. The Florida Project is really something magical. It has a very unique story that is shown through the lens of a six year old. It's a huge giant leap forward for Sean Baker as he manages to follow-up 2015's Tangerine with the superior The Florida Project. The cinematography feels like I'm living in a poverty stricken Florida. The Florida Project also makes you to feel empathy for the characters. They are all flawed but they also care for each other.",movies,1610932401,randomspawner,True,1,3,2021-01-17

When theaters open, we should get more comedies back then, idk why it’s just superhero and franchises movies as I only saw the first avengers movie, didn’t like it, and haven’t seen any since and comedies are my favorite genre as a whole.

Ed Wood (1994): Tim Burton’s best movie?,"Tim Burton has been the subject of ridicule in the 21st century due a batch of lackluster movies and his [constant collaborations with Johnny Depp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeQKBsi9edk). Burton's schtick just got old after a while. However, I recently watched a lot of Burton's early works for the first time (Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice) and I just marveled at how creative and fun they all were. And while I still haven't seen Edward Scissorhands yet (I know, I know) I think his masterpiece is [1994's Ed Wood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CawVaHxWvnA). 

Ed Wood is a biopic about Edward D. Wood Jr., who is considered one of the worst directors of all time. This movie chronicles the making of three of his movies: Glen or Glenda, Bride of the Monster, and Plan 9 from Outer Space. 

First off, all the performances is excellent. Sure, it's easy to make fun of Johnny Depp's constant collabs with Burton over the years, but Depp is truly amazing here. I love his energy and passion at getting these movies made. You manage to both laugh and root for him at the same time. Sure, he's swindling people out money of their own money to fund truly awful movies, but this movie manages to keep Ed Wood himself to be a very pitiful character. You just want him to succeed at the end of the day. 

The other great noteworthy performance is Martin Landau as horror icon Béla Lugosi who is simply electrifying. Like Wood, you really pity Lugosi with both his drug addiction and his loss of fame. There's this one scene where Lugosi awkwardly bombs on a variety show and it's just sad. Sure, the scenes where Lugosi spouts off profanity is historically inaccurate, but the performance is still amazing. 

Finally, I just love the look of this movie. The black and white is just gorgeous and fits in with the movie's setting. Not to mention the movie sets are decorated with immaculate detail. It's like Burton went back in time to shoot on a real Ed Wood set. 

All in all, I love this movie and it's my favorite Tim Burton film. If you're interested in becoming a filmmaker, Ed Wood is a must see. 

Fun Fact: Martin Landau's daughter, Juliet stars in this movie as actress Loretta King. Juliet Landau would later voice the Little Sisters in 2007's BioShock and the BioShock: Infinite Burial at Sea DLC.",movies,1610934883,ggroover97,True,1,36,2021-01-17

"To celebrate the Inauguration, I wanted to share my passion project: a feature-length spec script for a fourth Austin Powers movie, where Austin and Dr Evil both run for President","Sometime at the end of 2019, while reading an article about the Oscar race, I read that Bombshell - a potential Best Pictute nominee - was directed by Jay Roach. The auteur behind Austin Powers? I didn’t realize that over the past 20 years he’s become an extremely political filmmaker, who now almost exclusively makes movies about elections and political campaigns.

It was from this weird dissonance I realized that, if Jay Roach did return to the Austin Powers franchise - which, so far, he’s directed every single installment of - it would have to be this. An unabashedly and extremely politically radical cinematic redifining of the horniest film character of all time. 

So, here it is. Austin is back. Dr Evil is back. Throw them a frickin’ vote, here;

Which movies from the past decade will hold up over time? And vice versa?,"I'm talking about movies that were released from 2010 to 2019. Are there any movies released from that period that will hold up very well and movies that won't?

I think Mad Max: Fury Road will prove to be timeless. It will go down in history as one of the all time greats. Not only is it one hell of an action film, it's also so damn perfect in so many aspects that aren't even necessary for a good action flick. From its subversion of tropes to the cinematography to all the small details you only notice on second, third or fourth viewing. Not to mention the absolutely insane, perfectly choreographed practical effects.

And all that done by a director who hasn't made an action film in 30 years, and whose previous two films were Happy Feet and Happy Feet 2. And let's not get into the 10+ years the film was in development hell.

It's still blowing my mind that this film exists.

On the other hand, I can't imagine Black Panther's CGI in the third act holding up very well in the future.",movies,1610749401,randomspawner,True,3,47,2021-01-15

"Anyone who watched the tamil movie ""Master"" (2021), what'd y'all think?","I'm a huge fan of most of the actors in this movie (Vijay, Vijay Sethupathy, and Arjun Das), the director Lokesh Kanagaraj, and  the music director, Anirudh.

It's a great cast and group, and especially with the great marketing, music, and hype, the movie was just elevated. The plot was pretty good, and I really appreciated all of the little details. The fight sequences as well we're quite good (except for the archery one, wasn't a huge fan). The entry scene was amazing, from both actors, and I loved how they shared the screen space, treated as equals, instead of just all the presence going to Thalapathy. Vijay Sethupathy absolutely KILLED it as Bhavani, amazing villan, and an equal, if not better to Vijay's JD.
Lokesh's uniqueness is a bit missing, but it does happen when working with a big star, but still close to perfect. Anirudh absolutely killed it as well, with all the songs, seriously I don't think there's a single song in this movie that isn't absolutely amazing (especially Vaathi Raid and Master The Blaster, those are my two favorites). All the other actors were good as well, but a lot of them just didn't get enought screen time, but I understand why. Sathyan Sooryan has done really well as a cinematographer as well, but I think the shot angles could have been improved a bit more, the colors were perfect. It is a long movie at 3 hours, but I think it's worth the runtime, maybe a few scenes in the second half were not too important, but it sure as hell wasn't laggy like a lot of people say. I really did enjoy the movie, and think it brought me some joy after a long ass time at home. 

Just curious what y'all thought about the movie, especially in these times, after watching a new release after so long.",movies,1610750941,DH1605,True,0,2,2021-01-15

Struggling to appreciate certain movies,"In the past year I've begun to expand the types of films that I watch, and recently I've found myself watching more artsy or foreign language films. Just this past week I watched the three colors trilogy, and while I appreciate how well they are shot and how wonderful the performances are, I'm not able to grasp the underlying ideas behind them immediately.  In fact I had to rewatch blue and red a 2nd time and while my understanding has improved, I'm almost ashamed that I feel like I'm missing something. I decided to read a short essay about them and how the movies are based on the colors of the French flag as well as their motto of liberty, equality and fraternity. As I'm reading this I begin noticing all of the layers I've completely missed, even after a 2nd viewing. I'm not sure if its due to my lack of experience or that I'm not looking out for these hidden meanings, but seeing people unanimously raving about these films on letterboxd makes me wonder what I'm doing wrong. After reading reviews and articles about the movies I can understand why people love them so much, but for me to claim that I feel the same way rings hollow, after all it took reading other's opinions for me to finally understand. Do you guys find yourself scratching your head after a film, wondering what you're not getting?

Rocky Balboa (2006) is not that unrealistic,"Many people said Rocky Balboa was good but unrealistic. Rocky is somewhere between 55 and 60 in this film, challenging the HW champ in an ""exhibition"".

He does good becsuse Mason Dixon represents a weaker type of HW.

I think the fact that Mike Tyson came back at recently at 54 and basically beat the brakes off Roy Jones Jr (could have easily knocked him out tbh if he wanted) shows it is possible. 

Now could current Mike beat Anthony Joshua or Tyson Fury? (The current HW champs). No... but Deontay Wilder was champ for years until recently, and he is not skilled at all.

In fact, A LOT of boxing fans think current Mike Tyson could beat Wilder. If current Mike could beat Wilder, then I see no reason why its unrealistic in Rocky Balboa for a 55 year old Rocky giving Mason Dixon a tough fight, given how Mason is supposed to represent a HW champ who picks easy fights (like Wilder).",movies,1610759624,ThrowawayOgleks,True,5,16,2021-01-15

Dennis villeneuve's best movie?,"Dennis gets quite a lot of praise on here, and with dune coming up in the recent future, I think it would be interesting to delve into his filmography and see where he was at his best. 

I'm assuming that BR2049 is going to be the most popular choice for this, but I'm going to go against the grain a little and say that ""incendies"" is the best film he's made so far. Though I would probably put blade runner at no.2.

Incendies is a quite melancholy, and occasionally horrifying film that I feel does justice to the trauma and damage of war while doing it in an interesting and actually pretty profound way. 

The plot may be contrived (though what plot isn't to some extent?), but the overall story and message is pretty amazing, and the journey towards it very interesting.

"My friends (without seeing trailer or movie) called ""Hotel Rwanda"" and ""Schindler's List"" boring movies, even though they are rated way better than the ones they talk about, and it infuriates me.","So I like holding movie night with my friends sometimes (mostly online via discord). Lately I have been getting interested in history movies again, and remembered seeing the two movies in a title (among other historic movies of course). And when I recommend that to my friends and told them about the plot, they called it ""boring"" and ""stupid"". Without seeing the trailer. Without reading any critics.

"Can you think of examples of ""movie"" movies?","I was thinking of the idea of ""movie"" movies recently. What I mean by a ""movie"" movie is one that seems tailor-made to the idea of what a movie is supposed to be. Not that I mean that it is necessarily cookie cutter, but that it fills the Hollywood archetype. Everything is kind of what you expect.

One of the movies that got me to thinking about this was The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. The whole movie just seems to be very set piece: The music is appropriately ominous, the reactions of the main character and the villain are what you would expect, and the general plot is also what you would expect.

I read the Mad Magazine parody of the movie Love Story a long time ago...in the parody, one of the characters says that the movie is a ""movie"" movie. I've never seen it, but from what I can gather reading the synopsis, it does kind of seem like that.

Maybe I could think of some more examples.

It's a little hard for me to really delineate what I mean by the concept, but you can probably come up with some ideas.",movies,1610762616,IndianSurveyDrone,True,2,26,2021-01-15

The count of monte cristo (2002) - a very funny film,"The 2002 film is so bad that it is funny.

The character lacks in the film the intelligence and cruelty of the count of the book or even the princess olga of kiev.

She was a princess who started a massacre using traps and killed thousands of people. The count of the movie does not seem to be an authentic avenger like the count of the novel or olga of kieve. He's too generic to convince. There is no cruelty for the suffering he faced.

Olga of Kiev:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQv8nUHkUI&amp;t=622s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pQv8nUHkUI&amp;t=622s)

A few pathetic slogans along with poorly written revenge made this film a great slapstick comedy.

First they turned a hero byronic into a generic adventurer, turning a sophisticated and intelligent French nobleman into a fool who screams and leaps like crazy.

But no less ridiculous is Mercedes marrying a pregnant model and as if that would unite her with Edmond.

Let's quote the life of Alexandre Dumas to show how ridiculous this is.

Henry Bauër was born from the affair of Alexandre Dumas with Anna Bauër, a German of Israelite faith from the Baden country, wife of Karl-Anton Bauer, an Austrian commercial agent living in Paris, where he spells his surname ""Bauër"" with umlaut. After Karl-Anton emigrated to Australia, the child grew up with his mother. Skilled in business, she supports her son's education on her own.

The simple fact that Albert was Edmond's son with Mercedes was to unite them as Anna Bauër and Alexandre Dumas did not, much less father and son were close. This cliché is even comical in the film.

That ring scene when Mercedes and Edmond are reconciled is so forced. Feelings changes.

In the Soviet version, the director of the film falls in love with the actress who played Haydee and divorces his wife and marries her. A wedding of years ended in divorce and the 2002 film comes with a cheap cliché.

Feelings change.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Prisoner\_of\_Ch%C3%A2teau\_d%27If](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prisoner_of_Ch%C3%A2teau_d%27If)

[https://stories-of-success.ru/nadiry-mirzaevoi](https://stories-of-success.ru/nadiry-mirzaevoi)

soviet version:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=divSI1MIIJQ&amp;t=305s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=divSI1MIIJQ&amp;t=305s)

But there are those who consider the film better than the book. The recipe is the following: A lot of generic action scene and insert some stupid romance that is cliché.

There are those who consider that Edmond's return to Mercedes after her being alone and him leaving with Haydee improved the story As if the Disney solution was better.

The Thin Red Line (1998),"Not only one of my favourite war movies, but one of my personal favourite movies of any genre, ever made. I watch it maybe once or twice a year to keep it special, and I'm forever transported into the psychological hell of war.

Cast, cinematography, soundtrack, acting - drool, all stunningly beautiful. The philosophical and human elements of this film never fail to tug at my heart and ponder the utter insanity of war.

Amanda Seyfried gives the main character so many unique characteristics and personality traits that it's a marvel to watch her play Jill (The Protagonist).

The Grandmaster (2013) : Wong Kar-Wai's cinematic artistry continues...,"firstly i gotta admit,as someone who's not into martial arts movies, I loved every second of this one. After timeless classics like Chungking Express (1994),Fallen Angels (1995),Happy Together (1997),In the Mood for Love (2000) Wong Kar-Wai puts his mark &amp; shines again in his different &amp; last movie till date

I'll say it's not like those typical martial arts films as it heavily focuses on the storytelling rather than the action like the most ones,Don't get me wrong, u'll fondly love all the action scenes there is because of his legendary &amp; artsy cinematography.... for example? the Opening Scene of the movie,it won't take u long after that to tune into the film

the strongest part is obviously those slowmotion camera shots, Painting-like frames &amp; the background music adding to the beauty.....u'll find these stuff in most of those 2+ hours...and discover yourself getting engrossed into the Artistic Masterpiece (i hate to use the word Masterpiece left &amp; right bt it deserves it for the beauty)

the duo of Wong &amp; the legendary Tony Leung (IP Man) shines again after several previous films together, not to mention Ziyi Zhang (Gong Er) &amp; rest of the supporting cast who did great in their roles

if ur watching out for visually pleasing flicks,watch this one without having any second thoughts...(again,u'll love those slow-mo scenes).",movies,1610584990,ZunaidKun_,True,0,1,2021-01-13

Just rewatched the first 2 Transformer films and wanted to share my opinion !,"Personally I loved these films very much despite what critics and reviews say about them. Just the strong nostalgia and emotion I feel when watching these films, back when I was a kid and didn’t have to worry about anything. I personally refuse to consider any movie beyond Dark of the Moon canon as Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox aren’t in them. I think we can all agree that they both made the films amazing, their chemistry being a huge factor. I have never fully watched Dark of the Moon (only saw some clips) as I was extremely upset about Megan not returning but I watched some interview that the script was rarely changed despite her not returning. Basically all the scenes with Carly was meant to be Mikaela with some changes to the dialogue. As this is the case I personally just removed Carly from this film in my mind and just imagined it as Sam and Mikaela going through another adventure and eventually getting engaged (it was originally going to be Mikaela anyway). This is just my personal perspective and thoughts and I just wanted to know if anyone would like to put their opinions and give me their feedback in the comments. Please don’t put any negative comments, thank you 👏🏼",movies,1610586076,tyrone-wisdom,True,2,21,2021-01-13
[SERIOUS] The Silent Era consists of 1/3 of all film history and we should watch more films from that period,"The silent era began in 1893 with *Sortie de l'usine Lumière de Lyon* and ended in 1927 with *The Jazz Singer*. This is 33 years of film that's largely ignored by film buffs and critics for some reason. A film's runtime could vary from a mere 2 minutes to an epic 3 hours. It had comedy, horror, drama, adventure and romance.

Although the study done by the Library of Congress says that 75% of all silent films are lost, we can still watch the remaining 25% wherever we can watch it. Here's a list of my recommended silent films:

*Seven Chances* (1925)

*Pollyanna* (1920)

*The General* (1926)

*Hamlet* (1921)

*Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm* (1917)

*Little Lord Fauntleroy* (1921)

*Different From The Others* (1919)

*The Avenging Conscience* (1914)

*The Land Beyond The Sunset* (1912)

*The Phantom of the Opera* (1925)

*Alice in Wonderland* (1903)

*Hearts of the World* (1918)

GOOD or BAD: Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982),"Released in 1982, Halloween III is the biggest oddball in the Halloween franchise as it has nothing to do with Michael Myers. In fact, Halloween III eschews the slasher genre entirely and relies more on themes of witchcraft and science fiction. 

The movie, directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, follows a doctor (Tom Atkins) and the daughter of a murder victim (Stacey Nelkin) uncovering a plot by a small-town businessman to return Halloween to its dark, Celtic roots. 

Originally, producers John Carpenter and Debra Hill planned to shift gears with the Halloween franchise by transforming it into an anthology series with each new entry having its own different story. As far as I'm concerned, that sounded more interesting than rehashing the same Michael Myers storyline over and over again. 

Maybe if the movie was not attached to the Halloween franchise and just called ""Season of the Witch,"" it could have fared better. The movie has developed a cult following over the years so reception has warmed up. So do you find Halloween III GOOD or BAD?",movies,1610586465,ggroover97,True,1,27,2021-01-13

I thought Black Panther was going to be awesome with critics saying it's one of the best MCU movies. It was literally the same plot the MCU covered for over a decade only with worse CGI. The acting was pretty good and the costumes are great but that's the only things I liked. I don't think it deserves a 97% score on Rotten Tomatoes or a best picture nomination.

Best franchise blockbuster movies of all time?,"This is what I would consider as the top 10: 


**(1) The Empire Strikes Back** Most iconic original score ever, most quoted movie of all time, has a nearly perfect story structure, has the best cinematography of any Star Wars movie, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are like Hepburn and Tracy in this. Empire is crazy, the entire movie is essentially a super epic Maury Povich episode, paternity reveals and everything, with some Tibetan monk stuff thrown in the mix. The writing is actually super creative and it's all executed on the money. 


**(2) Raiders of the Lost Ark** Timeless adventure classic with the most influential action scenes of all time. Remember when that guy is swinging his sword around and Indy just rolls his eyes and shoots him? Yeah, this movie will never get old 


**(3) Fellowship of the Ring** All of the Lord of the Rings movies are amazing, but Fellowship has by far the best pacing and is the most rewatchable. Plus it has Gandalf the Grey. 


**(4) The Matrix** Basically the perfect mix of science fiction, the hero's journey, and Plato's cave allegory. The pacing and storytelling is excellent, but the only thing slighrly holding this movie back is the general aesthetic of it and the trench coats, but that's also part of the charm. 


**(5) Thor Ragnarok** Executes the MCU formula better than any other Marvel movie. Taika Waititi is a comedic genius and he brought that sense of humor to Marvel's universe to make what is essentially the ultimate parody of superhero movies. And while the movie is a complete farce, it still manages to have the best world building, visuals, and art style of any MCU movie, and out of all of them is by far the most distinct and rewatchable. 


**(6) Return of the King** This movie is just the epitome of epic and dramatic. Not much needs to be said about how great Middle Earth is and how well written the characters are. My only complaint with this movie is some plot conveniences and some pacing issues.  


**(7) The Dark Knight** Heath Ledger gave one of the greatest acting performances of all time and it elevates this movie by a substantial margin. There are several issues with plot and pacing, but it gets away with it because Nolan and Heath Ledger take this movie to such high peaks. 


**(8) Jaws** The movie doesn't exactly age that well, but you have to respect the original blockbuster for what it did in its time. It's still a pretty awesome movie in its own right, even just watching it in a vacuum. Probably the best monster movie of all time. 


**(9) Star Wars** The grandfather of all franchise movies, this is easily one of the most influential movies of all time. While the movie itself is highly flawed, it just oozes with charm and creativity. 


**(10) Guardians of the Galaxy** Completely reinvented the MCU from the bland early phases and defined the creative direction of what is now the biggest movie franchise in the world. This movie has a lot of flaws and the humor involves a lot of Marvel quips rather than actual comedy, but it gets points for being the heart and soul of an otherwise bland mega-franchise",movies,1610589245,ST0NE_C0LD_,True,1,21,2021-01-13

Rating all the films I saw during the Holiday Break,"What are your thoughts on some of these films?

This is probably the most amount of films that I have ever seen in a two week period.

The Rock - 8/10 - the ideal fun, cheesy and over the top summer blockbuster in my eyes

Die Hard 4 - 8/10 - another great installment to the franchise and it being PG13 does not bother me at all.  Great characterization of McClane and his dynamic with Matthew Farrel worked well (but not like his dynamic with Sam Jackson).

Rain Man - 9.5/10 - had no intention of viewing it but it was phenomenal.  Very delightful film and the growth with William Babbit is great.  The buddy dynamic worked really well.

True Lies - 7.5/10 - not as good as the other James Cameron films but it has great effects and has exactly what you expect from this style of film.  The one liners are superb but some of the comedy was weak and the stunt doubles were too obvious. 

Speed - 8/10 

Last Action Hero - 7.5/10 - way longer than it needs to be and it felt disjointed at parts. But the meta aspect was amazing and the one liners are some of my favourite in any movie ever.

Point Break - 7/10 

Fatman - 6.5/10 

Lethal Weapon  - 8/10 

The Prestige - 9.5/10 - amazing twists and great acting from everyone.  I see why this is often considered Nolan's best.

A Few Good Men - 9.5/10 

Zodiac - 9/10

Shutter Island - 9.5/10 

The Gentlemen - 8/10 

Terminator 3 - 8/10 

Terminator 4 - 7/10 

Greyhound - 7.5/10 

Rewatches 

Deadpool - 8.5/10

Deadpool 2 - 8/10 

The Social Network - 10/10 

The Departed - 10/10

Die Hard 3 - 8.5/10 

Man of Steel - 8.5/10

X-Men: Apocalypse - 7/10

GOOD or BAD: Spectre (2015),"The Daniel Craig Bond movies have definitely had their ups and downs. For every Casino Royale and Skyfall, there is a Quantum of Solace and the subject of this post, Spectre.

Released in 2015 and directed by Sam Mendes (who returned from Skyfall), Spectre is regarded as a step down from the previous entry in the franchise.

It also marks the return of the criminal organization Spectre and the villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Christoph Waltz) which haven’t appeared in a Bond movie since 1971’s Diamonds Are Forever. 

So is Spectre really that bad?",movies,1610409390,ggroover97,True,1,22,2021-01-11

Will watching movies based on the ratings create a problem in the future?,"I just want to have a good conversation about this since the whole sub is full of movie fans, for a long time I have been watching movies based on ratings, my last 5 movies these and I rated them as follows:

Wonder Woman 1984 (Not based on rating, I just watch all Comic movies) - 6.5/10     
Soul - 9.5/10    
Raiders of the Lost Ark - 9/10    
Snowpiercer - 8/10    
Ex Machina - 10/10    

As you can see these movies were all chosen based on good ratings and I rated some of them even higher than they were rated online. I rarely watch bad movies now because of it, WW84 might have been one of the worst movies I have watched recently.

Will watching movies based on good ratings create a problem in the future? Like will I be left with a ton of low-quality movies to watch but not many good movies? How can someone who loves movies tackle this problem? Do you go into a movie knowing it's bad? Do you watch movies at random? Do you select an actor and bing their movie?

Anyway what's your opinion on this?",movies,1610410278,PO5IT1VE,True,1,20,2021-01-11

Portrayal of school and nerds,"So I am a self proclaimed nerd: I choose to do physics and further maths etc. And when I watch movies, I get seemingly overly annoyed about how they make out nerds to be complete social rejects and just really weird. Firstly, we aren’t all are, and secondly when they make them say something academically ‘smart’, it’s usually completely basic stuff. They make out that quadratics are something Einstein spent his life trying to figure out how to do. 

For future generations, I just don’t understand how these bad stereotypes that make it out as it’s bad to be smart or passionate about academics, are still tolerated. Why are we trying to put off our next cancer cure finders??

"The Talk of the Town, and some timely social commentary","We’ve been working our way through the Cary Grant comedy collection on The Criterion Channel, and hit upon “The Talk of the Town”, with Jean Arthur, Ronald Colman, and Grant. I’m a sucker for the 30s and 40s era romcoms, and this is one that I hadn’t previously heard of. 

Knowing that it’s a comedy, one can tell there’s something special, with the opening jailbreak sequence that could have come out of most any noir film of the era (if you ignore the silent stupidity of the guard). It continues slowly as Grant, playing the accused arsonist and killer Leopold Dilg, makes his way to a rental house owned by Nora Shelley (Jean Arthur), with the humor picking up, but it turns screwball shortly after when Shelley’s summer tenant, crotchety law professor Michael Lightcap (Colman, with an elegant goatee) , arrives a day early.

The story shows its depth as Shelley struggles first to get rid of Dilg, then to keep him hidden, then to pretend he’s her gardener, and finally to convince Lightcap to help defend him. Bits of mystery tactics sneak in, one involving borscht with a raw egg.  The philosophy of law took an opportunity to elevate the film, as Lightcap and Dilg debated the idealistic theory versus practical necessity.  I found the film kept a tighter grip on my attention than the other Grant comedies we’ve been watching. 

But I’ll cut to the other, relevant end of the film, where Lightcap shows up in the courtroom to save the day just as a lynch mob breaks in against an understaffed police presence (sounds familiar?), to attempt to take justice into their own hands. I don’t know whether the Criterion Channel edited their blurb to include the “timely social commentary” point (yes, I plagiarized the phrase), but the film pauses at this point, not merely to have Lightcap introduce his proof of Dilg’s innocence, but to make a powerful speech to the mob on how America depends on the rule of law, making us “free men in a free country” and they should take their weapons home to destroy them, rather than engaging in violence to destroy the law.  It’s an oddly political piece to insert into a solid comedy, perhaps penned by co-writer Sidney Buchman, who was later blacklisted during the McCarthy era. But it’s an extraordinarily relevant speech in light of last week’s events.

As an aside, another thing that stands out is the role of Lightcap’s valet, played by Rex Ingram, breaking free of Hollywood’s confines for black actors of that era by being an intelligent and literate assistant and sounding board to Lightcap’s professorial idiosyncrasies.",movies,1610411585,Curmudgy,True,1,3,2021-01-11

Question about The VVitch,"Hi! 

I’m on a binge of the A24 Horror Films and I might get flack for criticizing such a beloved movie, but The VVitch left me with a big question and I’m just wondering if anyone has any more information on this because I can’t find a thing on the internet about it. 

How did the director go about protecting the children in the film from the inappropriate scenes we see on screen that included them? Was anything done to limit involvement or was it just consensual with the families/child actors? I held off on watching this movie for a long time because I knew there were some traumatizing sexual elements that included the kids, and I’m just wondering if any info was ever provided for this specifically? I know that the movie is extremely beloved and I did enjoy it, but it does raise concern in me that I’ve never heard anyone speak on the protection of the child actors. I love a good cult classic as much as the next person, but???

Hot take: Tarantino is not that great of a filmmaker,"First off, I'm not saying he isn't good, he clearly has a lot of talent. I think his number one ability is that he is able to get great performances out of his actors. Even though he himself is a terrible actor, he seems to have a great understanding of acting in general because he really does bring the best out of his cast. 

As far as directing, I think he's great at making references to other movies. I know that sounds like a backhanded complement, but I genuinely think he is great at remixing and sampling stuff from the past and making it work into his own thing.

Beyond that, his primary claim to fame is his screenwriting, which to be honest I find extremely overhyped. For starters, a lot of his writing just hasn't aged well, whether it's outdated pop-culture references, his overplayed foot fetish, overuse of racial slurs and stereotypes. The characters all talk like extensions of Tarantino, and while I understand that it is meant to be sort of ""Shakespearean"" for a lack of a better word, but it is quite hit and miss. Sometimes it just feels like Quentin having conversations with himself and just going off on dumb tangents. It works when the quips are funny, but when the jokes don't land it's painful to watch. 

I also feel that his movies that were edited by Sally Menke just worked a lot better. After she sadly passed away his movies started becoming bloated messes that didn't quit have that same Tarantino style, and it really highlighted how important Menke's editing was to Tarantino's films.  

As far as the production and finance side of things, I find Quentin's association with Harvey Weinstein to be a little suspect as well to be honest. 

As a whole I think his movies are good, and unique, but they are not timeless and Tarantino isn't the great filmmaker he is cracked up to be.",movies,1610413180,ST0NE_C0LD_,True,1,29,2021-01-11

Sound of Metal (2020) is 3D for the ears.,"Sight, Sound, Smell, Taste, and Touch. 

These are the 5 basic senses that humans  typically have to help understand and perceive the world. The idea of losing any of these senses is arguably a tremendous blow towards having the full human experience. Atleast, that’s what it feels like initially to someone who hasn’t lost it. 

But that’s not fair. There are those who were never born with all of the senses. Some who never had the ability to see or hear. And many who lost a sense while on the journey of life. Plenty of examples show people have been able to live full and productive lives. It’s been documented that many gain a new enhanced perspective on life that may even be more enriching than the experiences they’ve had under the previous constraints. 

That doesn’t minimize the anguish of losing a sense. Especially one so sudden and this film explores what happens when a drummer suddenly, in a blink of an eye, loses the ability to hear. 

Riz Ahmed as Ruben Stone presents an outstanding and realistic performance of a man who feels he’s losing everything. 4 years sober, his life consists of living a gypsy rock life with his girlfriend Lou as they tour together performing heavy (and I mean heavy) metal. When Ruben loses the ability to hear, he finds himself in a place for deaf recovering addicts as he settles into a new life. 

What makes this film special is the sound design. This is a film worth watching on a laptop with headphones.  It allows the viewer to become totally immersed into the experiences that Ruben is having. From the sounds of heavy metal, to the subsequent ringing and hissing that accompanies the deterioration and loss of hearing. The sound can be best described as metal....sound of metal. 

Wonderful acting and tremendous sound design. This unique film is one worth watching. 3D for the ears.

"First time watching ""Some Like It Hot"".","Honestly one of the funniest movies I've seen. If you've ever watched *Tootsie* (if you haven't, you should), then you'd know this movie has almost the exact same premise apart from a few key details. But my god, does Billy Wilder execute this idea well. Every single joke is memorable.

Two hours later I am much more convinced that no one should have to suffer through this movie ever again. 

The actors and the acting was superb. I love Christopher Walken, De Niro, Streep, and Fredo but the plot was long, drawn out, and boring.

The Florida Project is what Hillbilly Elegy wanted to be.,"The Florida Project offers a more sensitive and more authentic portrayal of poverty. In a way that is 1) not primarily concerned with getting Oscars (and because of that humility, it didn’t) and 2) is not a non-stop pity party, but instead shows the humanity of its subject by having scenes that contrast difficulty with scenes of them finding joy, even in their circumstances. The Florida Project strikes a balance between recognizing that both personal choices and systemic failings have worked together to create the situation the characters are in, but that they aren’t to be looked at like bugs under a microscope or as New York Times profiles elites can read about to feel educated by, but instead as people who are as real and familiar as our family and friends. 

Hillbilly Elegy handles poverty in a corny and overly schmaltzy way. It tries its damnedest to be apolitical, which is pretty comical given the circumstances. Plenty of people will love or hate this movie based purely on their political leanings, but honestly it’s just mediocre. It doesn’t have anything interesting to offer in terms of direction, performance, or artistic vision. Ron Howard is an experienced and competent filmmaker, so nothing here is especially catastrophic. But he’s clearly being very cautious, balancing moments of histrionic drama within a familiar story arc. Despite being based on real people, most of the main cast feel like stock characters.",movies,1610237302,randomspawner,True,1,5,2021-01-09

GOOD or Bad: David Lynch’s Dune,"Released in 1984 by surrealist auteur David Lynch, Dune is based on the 1965 novel of the same name by Frank Herbert. 

This movie definitely had a lot of things going for it. The cast included the likes of Kyle MacLachlan, Patrick Stewart, Max von Sydow, Brad Dourif, José Ferrer, and Sting (the musician not the wrestler). Dune also a soundtrack with tracks by rock band Toto and Brian Eno. 

Despite bombing at the box office and receiving negative reviews, this adaptation has gained a cult following. 

I guess I’m asking a two-pronged question here. Is the 1984 Dune a GOOD or BAD movie by itself? For instance, if you had no knowledge of the source material, would you still find it a good movie?

The second part is whether or not it’s a good adaptation of the source material. Does David Lynch’s Dune do justice to the OG book?",movies,1610239745,ggroover97,True,1,47,2021-01-09

I didn’t like Color Out Of Space (2019),"The premise of the film was cool, I enjoyed the cinematography, and I really enjoyed the sound.

But it just fell flat, the story was there but incoherent and inconsistent, sometimes I felt it hit big and then others missed quite a bit.

I would like to know why so many people enjoyed this film as it was highly recommended to me.

I did enjoy seeing Cage’s madding throwback to his performance in Vampire’s Kiss although it did feel a bit out of place.",movies,1610248522,EmotiveCDN,True,1,10,2021-01-09

Bad Movies: New Year’s Eve (2011),"Now I don’t watch Garry Marshall movies as they weren’t particularly made for my demographic but seeing as it was New Year’s Eve and the movie was streaming on HBO Max, I decided to watch it for the novelty of watching a movie called New Year’s Eve on New Year’s Eve. Man, was it TERRIBLE! 

That was two hours of my life wasted. What a waste of a decent cast. Nothing worthwhile happens in this movie. It’s just a bunch of cliched storylines and non-existent jokes stretched out out for what seems like an eternity.

Maybe if the movie cut down on the storylines and worked more on developing characters and their personalities, it could have worked, but it just doesn’t.

I don’t care about any of these characters. I don’t care if Michelle Pfeiffer has a good time or if Ashton Kutcher finds the true meaning of New Year’s Eve. I just don’t care. 

Not to mention what a waste of talent. Robert De Niro is bedridden for a chunk of the running time. Sarah Paulson is just there. Even John Lithgow is in this for about 1 minute. It’s like the only point of these movie is to assemble all of these people and create one giant waste of time. 

It was so, so, SO bad and not even bad in an entertaining way. I would rather go down to Times Square in sub-zero temperatures on New Year’s Even than see this again.",movies,1610250743,ggroover97,True,1,2,2021-01-09

I am losing my brain cells for an old movie that I used to watch as a kid,"Help me out guys, I'm about to lose it! If you know the name of this movie please comment below:

This movie is about a dragon ""prince"" whose tribe was at war with another tribe and his mother got him out of the fight when he was just an egg and got to the surface world, she then froze bacasue dragons can't live long on the surface and the egg hatched years later.

A vulture couple found him and raised him as a vulture with their own children, then apparently he learned to breath fire and stuff and a dragon girl from his tribe came to the surface, found him and gave him some spell so he could return to his original size (because he is supposed to be underground and the cold makes stuff shrink, y'know.)

And then there is this EPIC montage of the training, with ""the eye of the tiger"" playing in the background, he received so he becomes qualified to defeat the other clan's evil dragon lord that his own tribe couldn't overthrow after years of enslaving them.

Then he says goodbyes to his vulture family and arrives at the underground volcanic (minecraft nether like) world that the dragons lived in, and thwarts the evil dragon lord after an intense fight.

I'm sorry I can't remember all the details, but all I can remember is that I was watching it non stop as a kid and I have so many memories linked with it, sleepovers and friends' houses and stuff, the animation was mediocre and the production value wasn't all that good but I really want to watch it once more.

Please please please, if you know it's name, comment below and let me know!

Thanks for reading to this point, I know it is not all that relevant but I'm thankful that you wanted to help a stranger out :)

Michael Fassbender was incredible in Shame,"Michael Fassbender was incredible in Shame

I am starting to watch more of his films and was blown away by his performance in this film. The film altogether could have been better but his performance was heartbreaking. The emptiness and shame of an addiction was wonderfully portrayed. The film did garner some acclaim but the next collaboration between him and Steve McQueen which was 12 Years a Slave got a lot more attention.

Tenet is the first Christopher Nolan movie that I genuinely couldn't sit through,"I paid a fair amount of money to rent this movie and despite my best efforts to sit through it I had to turn it off about an hour in. I don't even know where to start. The movie just jumps from scene to scene of exposition dialogue that's hard to even comprehend due to the loud ass score (which is quite good to be fair, just needs to be turned the fuck down). The dialogue is completely laughable, especially Kenneth Branagh's monologue about what he was going to do to The Protagonist for sleeping with his wife. The first inverted fight scene in the harbour after they crashed the plane was worst than that infamous rooftop fight scene in The Dark Knight Rises. There was just no weight to the way they were slamming each other against walls and punching each other, just so sloppily executed. I could go on forever about how much this movie just irritated me and I only watched an hour of it! I love Nolan but this was just a serious misstep for me, I've read a lot of people saying that he shouldn't be writing movies on his own and I agree.",movies,1610063354,broheimlich,True,0,23,2021-01-07

Ranking David Lynch's Work after First Watch,"\*I have not seen Dune but will after I read the original novel.

11. Wild at Heart - I wasn't a big fan of this Palme D' Or winner, but I didn't hate it either. It was his most meh film I would say.  

2.5/5

10. The Straight Story - The biggest outlier in his filmography and one that I liked, but I will probably rewatch it soon.

3.5/5

9. The Elephant Man - It took me a while to get into it, but it is definitely his most devastating film and one that everyone should watch.

4/5

8. Inland Empire - It's a tossup between Dern in this movie and Watts in Mulholland Drive for the best performance in a Lynch film for me. Easily one of the most confusing movies I've seen and one that I need to watch a couple of times to get a better grasp. 

4/5

7. Twin Peaks : Fire Walk with Me - The prequel to the original series and was hated by critics when it came out. I liked this one a lot and is one that is really haunting.

4.5/5

6. Eraserhead - Lynch's debut was very bizarre and one that I really enjoyed watching. Many different interpretations are viable and I especially liked the Industrial Revolution type setting.

4.5/5

5. Blue Velvet - After seeing Mulholland Drive before this I thought this would be more surreal than it actually was. I still loved the film and felt it was the film that most feels like the original Twin Peaks due to the small town, big secret type story. Frank was a great villain and this is probably my favorite film of the 80s.

5/5

4. Twin Peaks : The Return - The revival was amazing with some spectacular episodes like Part 8,16,17. It didn't feel like the original series but I liked the shift a lot and was entertained throughout.

5/5

2/3. Mulholland Drive/ Lost Highway - I honestly can't decide which of these films I loved more. Both are similar as they blur the line between reality and fantasy. Definitely will watch both of these again soon. It's one of these films I would say is Lynch's best film.

5/5

1.  Twin Peaks : Obviously Lynch didn't direct all of it, but he was still actively involved in the show's creative process except the middle of season 2, which wasn't great. This is one of my favorite pieces of media I've ever watched and look forward to rewatching it all soon.

First film festival I'll be seeing more than one film ""at"". Passes and tickets went on sale today, and I was able to secure my top picks; hoping to purchase a few more before everything sells out though. Some of the bigger titles like ‘On the Count of Three’ directed by and starring Jerrod Carmichael, and ‘Prisoners of the Ghostland’ starring Nicolas Cage have already been wiped out (as of now — some virtual festivals that took place last year added spots after ""selling out""), but most are still currently available. There's different passes if you can afford them and want to tackle a bunch of stuff (you ""reserve"" films instead of buying a ticket). They also partnered with independent theaters across the US to screen some of the films if you'd prefer going out; it's mostly drive-ins and then a few ""socially distanced"" screenings I believe.

Scarface, Octavio the Clown shot at the club (around the 2:24 mark) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xe9PgMJbiMk

Natural Born Killers, the cook shot in the face and the redneck who gets the knife in his back (at 2:28 and 2:40, respectively) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dH1QmfQnWbg

A man and a lady I think the mans name was Blake was in climbing gear, there were in some sort of large cylinder building with only a ladder. Blake says someone along the line of 
“ He couldn’t hold on anymore and fell and splattered where we very stand “. Then the lady spots blood and says “ Is that blood!? “ Then they start climbing up, and when their near the top the lights go out and Blake disappears. When the lady turns her headlight on theres is a monster that resembles a lady in front of her on the ladder. Trying to run away, she climbs up and makes it to the top.

I can't decide if Colin Treverrow is a hack or having a go at me (this is about Jurassic World and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom),"So I decided to revisit these two movies because what else am I do? I had seen them both one time each, on opening night, back when going to the movies was a fun thing to do.

As I sat down to re-watch them I wondered if I would enjoy them. I enjoyed the first one and thought the second was insultingly stupid. I wondered if my opinions on the two might drift toward each other and I might meet in the middle, only kind of tolerating both.

Instead, I'm more confused than ever, and at the heart of it is Colin Treverrow. 

Let's start with Jurassic World. What can I say about it? I guess...There were dinosaurs?

But after four movies already, plus an assortment of King Kong films over the years (which are obligated to feature a T-Rex), not to mention a handful of Godzilla movies, is it really a novelty anymore?

When the first Jurassic Park premiered it was right in the sweet spot era of computer-generated effects. Things would only get more realistic of course, but things had progressed enough to be realistic enough to look…well, real, for the first time. And sure, Jurassic Park uses every trick in the book to bring their dinosaurs to life, but CGI played a big part in it and helped make a movie whose effects still hold up today.

Almost thirty years later there simply is no novelty anymore. It’s old hat. You show me a dinosaur on the screen and it’s just another cool effect. That’s jaded and cynical, sure, but…well, there it is. In order for this series to succeed in the 21st century it needed to rethink things; you can’t keep going back to the island and having crazy things go wrong. That idea was worn out as early as The Lost World in 1997.

When Jurassic World premiered over five years ago, it did so with a huge wellspring of hype. It dropped right in the sweet spot of the nostalgia age, where ticket-buyers were eager to return to the movies of their youth, no matter how derivative they might be.

And boy was Jurassic World derivative.

Was it fun? Sure. Was it stupid? You bet. But was it fun? I already said it was. Nevertheless, there's something just a bit off about it, a few things that really work, and a lot wrong with it.

I had hoped that the explanation/exposition-heavy dialogue would be contained to the trailers. But nope, that’s 90% of the dialogue in the movie too.

The original movie had exposition as well, but of course that film was fresh and original and intriguing. People wanted to know what was going on, and Spielberg paced the movie so that the explanations were punctuated by some great character moments that managed to feed into the plot: Dr. Malcom would hit a zinger that would reinforce the “man messing with nature” theme, John Hammond would have a great line that showed how obtuse he was while trying to play god. Those lines moved the story forward. The exposition in this film just moved in circles and stalled the movie.

So my biggest knock on the film may be something that you don’t mind; not everyone cares about dialogue when they go to an event film. If that’s you then you probably love this movie, because for me the biggest knock against it was the unnecessary cheese. All of the necessary cheese was done brilliantly, and when the characters stopped talking and started running the film soared. The thrills, moments of horror, exciting action scenes all worked just as they should. But when the characters stopped to “reflect” or to “discuss” or to “ramble on about the meaning” or “the plan,” that’s when things started to falter.

But the real takeaway for me is what I think is really going on here. I think Jurassic World is secretly a satire on the state of Hollywood Franchises.

No one in the movie ever comes out and derides the “bigger and more everything” premise behind the plot, so either it was a subtle message from the director or I’m just crazy. But the entire idea behind Jurassic World, the in-movie theme park I mean, is that the attractions have to get bigger and bigger to the point of ridiculousness. At one point it is stated that crowds are no longer “wowed” by dinosaurs, in a line I couldn’t decide if it was directed at the fictional ticket-buyers IN the movie, or real ticket-buyers who go TO the movies. The idea that people would get bored of dinosaurs seems outlandish until you consider the diminishing box office returns of the original Jurassic Park trilogy. The first one grossed over a billion dollars (after re-releases), the sequel brought in over 600 million and the third one did about half of that, with 360 million.

Both of the original sequels tried to up the ante, but missed what worked: The Lost World brought a T-Rex to San Francisco, to terrorize a huge populace, because the studio thought bringing the action closer to home would resonate more. JP3 introduced a dinosaur (Spinosaurus) more ferocious than Rex because the studio execs thought the old was out of style. The violence ramped up again and again, as did the body count, but along the way the audience lost interest. 

So for fifteen years the franchise sat dormant. Now it’s back and the original sequels were been de-canonized in order to bring us Jurassic World, a movie with more people to be terrorized, a dinosaur more ferocious than the T-Rex, more violence, more horror, and more death, all because the fictional “corporate” big wigs behind the theme park are worried about the audience losing interest.

This isn’t a Jurassic Park movie. This is a movie ABOUT the Jurassic Park movies.

Even the charismatic foreign tycoon funding the whole thing is a parody of the generic hollywood exec, so sure of his own genius when it’s the guys doing the dirty work that deserve the credit. This guy gets a hilarious moment late in the film when he approaches his personal helicopter, intending to fly it over the park in order to shoot down the antagonizing dinosaur villain of the picture. As he gets to the chopper, a worker shouts at him “Isn’t there anyone else who can fly that?” And then he turns around, as dramatic music swells, and the camera zooms in, and he replies “We don’t need anyone else.”

I laughed out loud, but I don’t know if it was supposed to be a parody or if that was supposed to be a serious, dramatic moment. Surely not, because five minutes later that chopper was going down in flames.

Throughout the movie, the scientists, park promoters, etc, all kept talking up the Indominus Rex (“Indominus” from the Latin meaning “unable to be dominated” or “unable to be trained”) as this Dino that was “so way cooler than the T-Rex, for reals.” They spent a lot of time trying to convince you of that too, even starting the “oh crap it’s loose” story a lot earlier than I thought they would, just to have more time to establish the terror this I-Rex can cause.  But in the end, who stands tall? Who has the last word roar? Whose face is on the logo? In fact the whole movie was a love letter to the T-Rex and the Raptor, the unquestioned stars of the first film. Like Hollywood, it was obsessed with rebooting, restarting, reimagining, but in the end it always goes back to the old favorite, because that’s where the emotional connection lies.

Looking back and rewatching the first World movie, I still don’t know for sure if writer/director Colin Trevorrow was trying to make a film that was actually about dumb Hollywood reboots, but if he wasn’t then he’s a hack. If he was…he’s Ed Wood? Is that better?

And then there's Fallen Kingdom.

All I know is when I sat down for the sequel I wondered if they would try and do another secret satire. Now that I’ve seen it…no, they did not...I don't think.

Jurassic World 2 is somehow two half-baked movies shoved together. It’s the beginning of a by the book Jurassic World sequel, one that goes back to the island but with more stakes, more action, more blah blah blah. And then, following ten minutes of mind-numbing exposition, it’s the second half of a different Jurassic World sequel, one that would have been about something new, something that would have moved the franchise forward, away from the island and to a true “world” setting.

But instead of taking those two ideas and making two fully-fleshed out movies, writer Trevorrow took the first half of the first idea and the second half of the second idea and stitched them together, much the way the mad scientists in the movie keep trying to stitch together new dinosaurs from existing parts OH CRAP IT *IS* A SATIRE! IT’S A SPOOF OF THE PREVIOUS MOVIE’S OWN INANE PLOT!

The Final Act in Rogue One,"Just randomly popped up on my tv today and I started at watching at the perfect time. The middle of the movie drags a bit IMO but everything on Scarif is just fantastic. I’m sure it’s been said before but it really felt like a well-done war movie that just happened to be set in the Star Wars universe. I’m also not sure if it’s just me, but the ending made me much more emotional than I expected. I appreciated that all the characters died during my initial watch but their deaths really impacted me a lot more this time. I don’t know if it’s because of everything going on, but seeing a group of people put the greater good above their own well-being was legitimately very moving for me. Everyone willing to sacrifice their lives for such an important cause really impactful. And Jyn’s speech about the need to get the Death Star plans was great! It didn’t really do anything for me the first time around but it actually felt inspiring this time around. 

Seeing the initial sparks of the Rebellion was really enjoyable too and did a great job of emphasizing that the Empire are the *bad* guys. It can be easy to glorify the Empire a little because of the general aesthetic and Darth Vader but I think this movie really cut through a lot of that. I was definitely one of the people who thought the Vader scene at the end was fucking amazing when I first saw it but seeing it again, I couldn’t help but feel the dread the Rebels felt instead of awe at Vader’s power.

The Matrix Reloaded deserves more respect!,"Obviously, Reloaded was never going to reach the same heights as its predecessor, but it was still a wonderfully entertaining movie with some fantastic action sequences. It's just unfortunate that it gets lumped together with Revolutions, as I do find that the story really began derail in that one as there was far too many ideas &amp; plot threads all being juggled at once (especially within the real world bleh) 

Reloaded still had us intrigued in the world, created by the Wachowski's and the film didn't waste a single second on delivering more of the goods that filmgoers craved from the first film. Most of the set-pieces here that are set within the world of the Matrix are honestly pretty incredible, still to this day. Wonky CGI aside - the burly brawl, chateau fight and freeway chase are still thrilling to watch and make us feel like we are exploring more of the supernatural stuff that actually exists, within this computer generated world (like the twin ghosts). 

The movie is far from perfect and some of the philosophical ideas start to get tangled in a web as they're being shoved down the audience's throat. But apart from that - and Neo's invisibility - I think that The Matrix Reloaded serves as a fulfilling bridge to the huge anticlimactic final chapter that is Revolutions. It's far from a perfect sequel but I'd wager it's actually better than you remember it being and deserves some more admiration for its mammoth ambition.",movies,1609890041,Deja-Review,True,0,0,2021-01-05

Debate: Whos the better action star/ has better movies? Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone?,"I've been on an 80's and 90's movie kick lately and I've thinking of the age old question: who had the better movies? 
Personally, Arnold no questions asked. 
But honestly Sylvester has been runnin up the ranks lately. 
Rocky 4 and Cliffhanger being personal favorites. He even has comedy chops in Oscar, which is pretty underrated I feel. 
Arnold just has a farther reach and influence, Terminator and Predator alone are too good. I really liked True Lies and Commando too, overall solid action flicks.

"Has there ever been filmmaking engineering as impressive as dragging a 320 ton ship over a mountain in ""fitzcarraldo""?","Watched this film again today, and I've been reminded of what an absurd and ridiculous achievement it is. 

Without the use of any special effects, the cast, in the middle of the Amazon, dragged a 320 ton steamship over a mountain and into a neighbouring river using primitive Winches and pulleys that they constructed themselves?

Utterly ridiculous. For a film about obsession and madness, everyone was method acting on set. 

The entire production of it was crazy, with people offering to murder the lead actor because he was pissing people off so much, people chopping off legs with chainsaws, paralysis, multiple deaths.....

Has there ever been a engineering feat as impressive as this when a film is being made? Bridge over the river kwai comes to mind, but I don't think it can beat it.

I recently rewatched the Prestige and I thought it was a near perfect movie until I realised an issue with Borden purposely giving Tangier his diary.,"I rewatched the Prestige over the Christmas period and don't get me wrong, it's a great film and a really underrated performance by Hugh Jackman. However, this isn't necessarily a plot hole but it's basically a square peg in a round hole that Nolan solves for himself far too easily. 

Tangier is obsessed with finding Borden's method to his Transported Man trick (that he alternates with Fallon). Tangier kidnaps Fallon and holds him hostage until Borden gives him the key word to unlock his diary (which he purposely had Olivia give to Tangier and ultimately was a fraud). This sends Tangier all the way to Colorado in the belief that Tesla created a machine for Borden that is the secret to his Transported Man. However, once Tangier reads that the diary is a fake, we as the viewer see that Borden sent Tangier on a wild goose chase  to distract and annoy him. However, it's not a wild goose chase as Tangier ultimately ends up with a cloning device. Borden doesn't know this, as he's later seen furiously trying to work out with Fallon how Tangier does his new transported man. 

This just annoyed me and whilst it's somewhat pedantic, I didn't like how Nolan had to rely on this sheer piece of 'luck' in order for Tangier to even up the playing field and bamboozle Borden for a change.",movies,1609899609,HanSoloHeadBeg,True,1,0,2021-01-05

I didn't like 2001: A Space Odyssey,"Every ""film critic"" and film teacher praises this movie like it’s the second coming of Christ and lectures those that didn’t like it that they just ""don’t get it.”

I’d like to think that I have a good appreciation for cinema and have looked into basic storytelling and movie structure. I understand that the movie does have all the elements of a story going on, and that they're disguised under Kubrick's visual storytelling. During my second viewing I kept in mind the themes (human evolution, human vs technology, etc) and subtle details Kubrick spreads throughout the movie to communicate the message, it still didn’t stop me from falling asleep.

Going off on a rant here: every action is dreadfully slow. The pod gets up and takes three minutes to turn 90 degrees and then give it another three hours for it to finish turning again. Oh there goes the monolith, time to take a 30 minute nap for it to go from point A to point B with nothing happening in between. David Bowman literally could not have taken the battery out of the satellite any slower, and when he started turning the screws to shut off the Hal-9000 I almost had a stroke looking at the amount of screws left to turn. The film's length is not a problem; I've seen films like Seven Samurai that are an hour longer than this movie without being bored for a second.

Also, the scene where David Bowman goes through dimensional travel is sure to have been incredible in the 60’s, but it just looks like I’m watching a vaporwave music video for 10 minutes straight. Just watching nonsensical visuals without any form of conflict or significance puts my brain into auto pilot.

Obviously I’m entitled to my own opinion. I appreciate the movie‘s visuals; they were way ahead of its time and each frame of the movie is perfection. My problem is that people can’t seem to scratch their heads around me not liking space odyssey, and I can't believe all these movie critics who claim Space Odyssey is ""their favorite movie"" actually enjoys the movie and doesn't just say it to feel superior to others who ""just don't get it."" 

I am certain that regardless of the masterclass visuals and directing 2001: A Space Odyssey is a better as a book than it was a movie. The film's message is fine and dandy and genius, sure, but if I can't sit through 5 minutes of the movie without blowing my brains out what is the point. Perhaps because I value intricate plotlines, exciting characters, and enjoyable screenwriting the most in movies, this classic didn't hit me as much as it did other movie enthusiasts.",movies,1609899815,Blymin,True,1,50,2021-01-05
Sports procedural movies - is that a thing?,"It could be a sport I don’t care about or know nothing about, but I just really like a sports movie where the bulk of it is about methodically figuring out how to beat the much better/richer team. It doesn’t necessarily have to be an underdog story though. 

The focus of the movie is usually coming from an outsider perspective and trying new/revolutionary ways to change the sport. The movies have a procedural feel as they get closer and closer to the goal.

I was a middle schooler upon first viewing so of course all the punch lines hit, and the story was nerve racking to me as a boy. 
Having good friends that I knew were making plans to go to different high schools than me, made me wish that I could use all the power at my disposal to have us all stay together. The thought that my close friend group would just slowly dissipate as one by one we all found more interesting ideas, beliefs, and people, until I felt that I had less power.

Looking For a Film from a Poster/Screencap....??,"I am looking for a film that I've been wanting to see for a whole but couldn't find or remember the name of.

I remember seeing a poster maybe four years ago, it featured a white, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, boy looking straight at the camera with a terrified/petrified look on his face, and a gun is pointed to his head. It wasn't really a ""poster"", it was more of a screencap. I saw the picture on TvTropes but I can't remember what it was called!

It looks old, like it was filmed on actual film and not digital, if that helps.

A massive misconception(?) about Wonder Woman 84's ending,"I keep seeing people say it doesn't make sense how every single person would renounce their wish to save humanity. But do they really have to?

People are assuming that if any wishes aren't reversed, the world just magically gets destroyed. And that's a false assumption. If you go back and watch the movie, the Mayan man talks about how his ancestors wouldn't reverse their wishes, which lead to the death of their civilization. He doesn't say that they ALL had to reverse them, or any specific wishes had to be reversed, things are left vague. What isn't vague is that in present day, the President's wish for more nukes directly leads to imminent nuclear war. That one wish is enough to destroy the world, and reversing it is enough to save it\*. So then, what does every other person's wish have to do with that? Like the coffee guy, it makes no sense for his wish to be tied to the fate of the entire world or even his city. Most of the wishes would have minor, localized consequences whether reversed or not. So no, everyone didn't have to reverse their wish to save the world, only major players like the President and the man in Bialya. I think this addresses a few plot issues:

\- how to deal with wishes that physically can't be undone (for example, wishing for sex - you can't un-have sex, that makes no sense)

\- how people could renounce wishes to save their sick children, or see their loved ones again (they didn't necessarily have to renounce)

\- how could Maxwell Lord's wish reversal retroactively cancel everyone else's wishes (it didn't)

Let me know what you think of this idea, whether it fits with your viewing of the movie, and if you agree that people are very confused overall. The last time I saw a film this misunderstood was BvS with the Martha scene.

\*Why did the President renouncing his wish = the Soviet missiles disappearing? I can't answer every question this movie raises, just trying to tackle the subject of this post. I know there are lots of other issues with this movie.",movies,1609715404,Uneequa,True,1,20,2021-01-03

The Man in the Iron Mask - plot problem (spoilers duh),"Firstly I will express that this film is underrated. A bit cheesy yes, but in the fun kind of way - intriguing plot, and some good acting in the mix. The queen is a really terrible person in this though. She is the only one out of the conspirators with perfect information. She knows D'Artagnan would support the switch if he knew he had another son but never passes this information to him (or to the other musketeers, who would have been able to recruit him). Instead she leaves Phillipe out to dry and invites disaster with her silence. Deeper than this though, why did she not make any motion to help Philippe when he was first imprisoned, including telling D'Artagnan. Plot may have been better served by having his existence concealed from her as well, increasing Aramis' burden.",movies,1609715986,ESComments,True,1,0,2021-01-03

Brief criticism and commentary on what I thought of the film Arrival.,"# Arrival

Rated: 5/5⭐

[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/film/arrival-2016/)

*There are those who say that Arrival is just a film about invasion / contact with aliens, I care to say that the film uses this only to justify the sci-fi factor and time travel, because from what I understand, it it is very much a film about communication, and how we use it. One of the greatest specters of humanity is the language, many countries, many nations, different colonizations, soon we will have different languages, thus making our communication more difficult, generating more and more cultural ""conflicts"". In the movie Arrival, humanity finds itself in danger in the face of unidentified and alien spaceships, apart from that all nations are forced to unite so that they can, first hand, understand what the purpose of those beings on earth is. Thus, the plot puts us in the vision of two characters, they are the protagonists, Louise Banks, a renowned linguist, together with her an experienced physicist Ian Donnelly. Their main role is to understand the language and purpose of ETs on earth. In short, in order not to give too many spoilers, by understanding how the Aliens communicate, the film aims to provoke a certain questioning, about how humanity relates and their differences. Thus showing at the end that, with the use of a universal language, brought by the Aliens, there can be world peace between nations.*

2020 films ranked according to the /r/movies official discussion polls.,"Had a few people asking for this in modmail so I figured I'd sticky it to ring in the new year.

Every week we post official discussions for widely released movies and attach a poll to each asking users to both rank the movies from 1-10 and whether or not they'd recommend them.  Those polls get compiled into the yearly list and the all time list every so often. 

Last year was obviously tumultuous when it came to film releases. We tried the best we could to keep up with the many streaming releases despite most of them making few waves. It was an odd year of seemingly more movies and less interest. Regardless, I think this method is one of the best we have for figuring a list for this sub. Sometimes we do Top 250 of all time voting threads but that uses the reddit voting system which is imperfect to say the least. I like this method because each movie is voted on individually by the people who saw it, generally speaking. So without further adieu, here are some stats from this year's polls. Check the bottom of the post for a link to the full results.



Rank | Film Title | Mean Score | Number of Votes| 
---|---|----|----
1 | Portrait of a Lady on Fire | 9.23 | 1,277
2 | Wolfwalkers | 9.09 | 94
3 | Hamilton | 9.04 | 1.906 | 
4 | David Byrne's American Utopia | 9.02 | 52 
5 | Small Axe: Mangrove | 8.74 | 42
6 | Small Axe: Lover's Rock | 8.73 | 37 
7 | Soul | 8.61 | 5,122
8 | Sound of Metal | 8.58 | 441 
9| Palm Springs| 8.51 | 2,728
10 | Promising Young Woman | 8.51 | 252

Much like rotten tomatoes, the less seen but high quality movies tend or movies with highly niche audiences tend to do well with this system because most likely only people who want to see them are seeing them. 

If you don't want to consider Hamilton and American Utopia movies then the next two spots would go to The Gentlemen and Phineas and Ferb The Movie: Candace Against the Universe.

Here are some more stats from the poll:

- The most voted on film was unsurprisingly Wonder Woman 1984 which pulled in 18,578 votes and averaged a 4.93 score. This almost doubles the second most voted on film, Borat Subsequent Moviefilm which pulled 9,819 votes and landed at a 7.8.

- The lowest scoring movie was Artemis Fowl at an average score of 2.37 with 769 votes.


- Obviously number of votes went down once theaters closed. Most of the theater releases like Birds of Prey, The Gentlemen, Onward, and Tenet pulled in &gt;1,000 votes. As for streaming releases, most Netflix releases pulled in over 1,000 votes such as Extraction, I'm Thinking of Ending Things, The Old Guard, Devil All the Time, Eurovision, Enola Holmes,  and Da Five Bloods. Even Horse Girl pulled in 1,500. Surprisingly, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom only pulled 231 votes.

- Hulu did alright as well with King of Staten Island and Palm Springs getting over 1,000 votes. Third place for Hulu goes to Happiest Season with 595 votes.

- Amazon Prime as far as I can tell doesn't pull in as many votes with the exception of Borat Subsequent Moviefilm which was the second most voted on film. Despite this, they got three films in our top ten. 

- Mank only pulled in 506 votes which was both on Netflix and directed by /r/movies darling David Fincher. 

Don't believe me?

How Depression Improved My Movie-Watching Experience.,"I've been battling with depression since my mid-teens, and I've always found the best way for me to deal with it is to deep dive into one of my hobbies. It just helps me take my mind off it and I generally tend to get over it. 

Sometimes it may be playing video games or reading books, or if the weather is nice, going for long walks in the woods or just doing work in my garden. But the one constant that has always been there to help me is movies. From trips to the cinema to just watching movies at home. 

I think it's the whole escapism that continues to draw me to movies. Growing up on the west coast of Ireland in the '80s and '90s you really did need some form of escapism to get through it. So just seeing the world from a different perspective than my own was always something that drew me in. It's like what Roger Ebert said: ""The movies are like a machine that generates empathy. If it’s a great movie, it lets you understand a little bit more about what it’s like to be a different gender, a different race, a different age, a different economic class, a different nationality, a different profession, different hopes, aspirations, dreams and fears. It helps us to identify with the people who are sharing this journey with us.""

I use to love checking out the latest trailer just to keep up with what was coming out next. Sadly in the late '90s and early 2000s, I was still on dial-up and downloading a trailer in ""high quality"" could take a few hours. [Like spending nearly four hours to download this trailer for Terminator 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBD9VKIvJqs). I also started a home movie collection, first on VHS, then DVD, and now blu-ray &amp; 4K. 

In the last few years, I started to have serious bouts of depression again, even to the extent that I was considering harming myself and even taking my own life. I think it was just a bad combination of things at the time, I felt that I was in a dead-end job, my latest relationship had ended badly, I had to move out of my apartment and it felt like life was throwing haymakers at me and I had little or no defence. 

I just started to binge movies to get me over the hump. I watched all of the Star Wars films, all of Harry Potter and Lord Of The Rings. Then I decided that I need to watch more films from before I was born, so I just started to buy random films on iTunes and blu-ray. Noir films from the '40s and '50s, Westerns from the '30-60s, New Hollywood films from the '70s etc, films from Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, China and Thailand. My mindset became, every film deserves at least one watch. 

And because of the above mindset, I've stopped watching trailers and stopped reading the vast majority of movie news, especially casting news and production news, and my whole movie watching experience has dramatically improved. I'm enjoying movies more now. I've noticed this more when I go see a comedy and my friends come out hating it and I enjoyed it because non of the jokes were spoiled for me. I've stopped reading reviews and listening to movie podcasts until after I've seen the film. It's gone from ""is this film worth my time and money"" to ""does reading/hearing this review help articulate my thoughts about the film better?""  

I know I will have some bad days ahead of but I also know that the vast majority of those days will be good. I know that whenever those bad days do come, there will always be a film I haven't seen yet that will help me get back on the right track and put in the right direction.

He was finally back to his old school style and the film itself had great performances and was exhilarating. Snatch is also one of his absolute bests. 

Iron Man 3 on the other hand, could have been made by anyone. It was a corporate studio movie with Ritchie's name there for show. And then you have dialogue such as ""I AM THE MANDARIN!!!"". Cringe is an understatement.

Protagonist is living life as usual

Then a news report comes on the TV and says a body has been discovered from a year back and it was the protagonist's. 

Everyone is confused because the protagonist has been with them all this time, but they realised the protagonist has disappeard. Every text message from them has been deleted and everything the protagonist bought for their friends/family in the past year has gone, because they're now dead so like I mentioned earluer, everyone is confused. 

The protagonist wakes up a year in the past, some guy tells him ""some guy is gonna kill you in a few days"" so he has to prevent his own death. Turns out a time traveler from the future kills him. 

Once he prevents his own death, he travels to the future, goes on a heist to steal the time machine and destroy the instructions for making a time machine and once that's done, he goes back to the present and destroys the time machine. 

The time he goes back to is a few weeks after his body is discovered, he meets up with his family/friends and everyone is happy.

I could never get the IMAX experience at home, even with my projection screen, I definitely don't have the means to get a top of the line sound system. I've seen where some theaters are offering private viewings for movies and that possibly would be a way to go, however that surely is a major loss for theaters' anyways, a group of 10 renting a theater vs 250 in a theater. 

I don't mind watching a newly released movie at home through a streaming service. However I'm counting the days for when I can see Top Gun 2 in IMAX because that's something im not gonna get at home the same.

**B Tier:**

- Hugh Grant

Hugh carries an otherwise pretty dull story. It's essentially just ""let's watch Hugh be Hugh for 20 minutes"", but he's good enough at what he does that that is actually a somewhat viable strategy.

**C Tier:**

- Martin Freeman 

The whole ""they're naked but making small talk"" shtick is admittedly funny. But that is the entirety of this story. And a gimmick, however funny, is just that, and can't be the meat of the story, which is otherwise ""man asks woman on a date"".

- American woman

I mean, this one just feels the most fillery. Yea, the brother is sad, but that doesnt make a story good or interesting. There just isn't much here. Woman has hookup interrupted. Also, the brother is in care, so she just needs to learn some better boundaries. It's not bad, just meh, and very forgettable.

**D Tier:**

- Neeson and Child 

Running through an airport to find the crush you don't even think knows your name? And for what end? A kiss, before she buggers off anyway. A postcard would have sufficed. It's all just a bit daft and silly, but that's not a terminal affliction in a romcom, so doesnt drag it lower than D. Would have been better if the kid and dad had really bonded over the story and that been the ""real"" relationship, but the kid is in his room drumming for most of it. Wasted Neeson is wasted.

**E Tier**

- Colin Firth 

*man has mid life crisis after discovered infidelity, rebounding into second marriage with woman he has never conversed with until the proposal.* Kooky *premise* of a wild romcom? Sure. Tense emotional drama? Sure. But the story of a romcom in and of itself? I don't buy it. Also suffers from classic romcom issue of people just not behaving like thinking humans to drive the plot. Him buying a portuguese to english dictionary on day 1, **or** giving her his contact details after she kissed him, would've made for both a more believable and better story.

**F Tier**

- Kiera and Co 

Eeish, what a trainwreck. Starts with creepy stalker secretly filming his best friend's bride *for his own private video collection*, continues with woman barging into guys flat unannounced and uninvited and searching through his stuff without permission, and ends with wife kissing her husband's creepy best friend on Christmas day.

Movies I watched in High School Classes,"Hello. Recently I came across a few films that I remember watching in high school. Following that, I tried to compile a list films I watched in high school. Most of these were chosen by the teacher and a few by the class. What I noticed was the quality of the films were unexpectedly high. Because of this I think this shaped my love and obsession with film. I decided to post the list here and would love to hear what films you guys watched in high school and see how it compares between all of us. With each movie I will give a short description on the reasoning behind the choice by the teacher, what class it was and what the class reception to it was. 



* **Natural Born Killers**  [IMDb (7.3/10)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110632/)

This was in art class. The violence and allround craziness was quite surprising to us as usually teachers don't pick these kinds of films. However the art teacher was a ''weird one'' so it wasn't that surprising at the end. The class really liked this movie. It's a good one and I recommend it. Woody Harrelson is really good in it. We did a few scene analyses too but I cannot remember which ones. 


* **Heaven &amp; Earth**  [IMDb (6.8/10)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107096/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)

Another Oliver Stone movie. This was shown in History class. Our two history subjects for our final year were the Dutch Golden Age and the Vietnam War. Our teacher picked this movie to watch as it pertains to the latter topic. It was quite a slow movie from my memory and therefore some people did not like it. There is also a bit of symbolism in it that high school students don't care too much for. However it was informative to a certain extent it gave a closer look into the war compared to abstract descriptions in our books. 


* **All Quiet on the Western Front (1979) ****  [IMDb (7.1/10)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078753/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1)

This WW1 film we also watched in History class. But the year before Heaven &amp; Earth. This one stuck with me as back then a war movie being realistic, grim, gritty, depressing and demoralizing was something no one had ever seen in our class. We were used to the blaze of glory like call of duty and Saving Private Ryan. A scene that still sticks with me is one that is around the halfway mark of the movie where there is a small moment away from all the misery of war where the main characters go and meet a few French woman. After that night ends its back to the misery again. This transition really demonstrated to me in the time the effects of war in reality. The class overall really liked this movie for its accurate description and the plethora of things it taught us about The Great War.


* **American History X**  [IMDb (8.5/10)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120586/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)

Oh this movie. This one had a sort of cult status in our school. Every 3rd year art class was going to watch this movie at some point. And of course the one famous sequence was known across the school. Everyone knew about it before they watched it and was eagerly anticipating watching this one.  &gt;!It's of course the sequence where the main character puts the jaw of an African American person on the edge of a stone sidewalk, forces him to open his mouth and then kicks him in the head. Such brutal violence was fueled by racism was not something any of us could imagine.!&lt; The film overall is I believe the one that stuck with students the most, it was shown in art class and everybody was on the edge of their seat throughout the film. It's a really good film that I recommend to anyone. 

* **The Motorcycle Diaries** [IMDb (7.8/10)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0318462/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_1)

My personal favorite of the list. It's a Che Guevara biopic. However it doesn't focus on his revolutionary period at all. Instead we get a beautiful roadtrip and coming of age movie with one of my all time favorite film scores by Gustavo Santaolalla. The film is based on the diary of Che himself. The cinematography is beautiful. It really succeeds in telling the story of who Ernesto Guevara was and how he transitioned into being famous in popular culture and counterculture. This was shown in Geography class, our teacher was a frequent traveler and heard about this movie in Argentina. To the class it showed who the guy on the t-shirts actually was. It taught us a lot about Latin American culture. Everybody loved this one and we rewatched it with scene analyses a second time. 


* **Der Tunnel** [IMDb (7.7/10)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0251447/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)

Der Tunnel was shown in German class. It's a German film about the German divide in the Cold War and is based on true events. It showed the class the reality of life for people in East-Berlin and East-Germany. Something no one expected to be that chilling, intimidating and unimaginable. The near perfect depiction of the Stasi in the film is also one of the scariest thing I have ever watched in film. The class loved this one and its a film we stayed after hours so we could finish it on the same day, its very well made and intense. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in how life was during the Cold War for people stuck in East-Germany.


* **Paris, je t'aime** [(7.2/10)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401711/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)

This was shown in French class and introduced us to the anthology format of film which we didn't know existed. It was a good film but I can't remember much of it, its not really a film that sticks with you.  It was cool how all the short films were set in different arrondissements of Paris, it showed quite a lot of different areas and subcultures of Paris. This being a more romantic movie, some people in class didn't enjoy it too much. 

* **Taxi (1998)**  [IMDb (7.0/10)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0152930/)

Also in French class. This is a really good French action movie. Think small scale Fast &amp; Furious with more comedy. It was a really fun movie and everybody loved this one. It spawned a few sequels which weren't too good and an American remake (which was terrible). 


* * **Christiane F.** [IMDb 7.6/10](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082176/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_8)


The best description for this movie is: German Requiem for a Dream. It's an anti-drug movie that the German teacher showed to every 2nd year class. I always pleaded with the teacher to watch Der Untergang instead but she always said that it was too disturbing and inappropriate. Well queue this movie which has a plethora of disturbing scenes, including underage sex, detox with the vomiting and sleeping in it included. Color me surpised at the end of this movie after the teacher saying week after week Der Untergang isn't appropriate. Anyway, this movie is good. Its an accurate description of heroine addiction and all the disturbing realities of it. Don't know if I would recommend it, it's not a fun experience. 


Next film will be the last on this list, I probably made it a bit too long, sorry for that. 


* **Wall-E** [IMDb (8.4/10)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910970/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0)

This one our chemistry teacher chose for us to watch during the last class before Xmas break. We were all surprised by this choice, we thought it was a childrens movie and tried to change his mind but he was set on watching Wall-E with us. This was a very well-liked teacher by every class, he was great so we accepted it pretty quickly. 

Color the entire class surprised during the entire first hour. Such a well made film. Even though the part in space isn't as good as the first section we still all loved it. This is a really a film for all ages. Next year we watched Ratatouille with the same teacher and that turned me into a Pixar fan. I then watched all their films as soon as I could. Going to watch Soul tomorrow!




Thats the end of the list. I would love to hear your stories and experiences of watching films in High School classes. And your thoughts also on the movies in this list. Thanks for reading!",movies,1609724646,xCesme,True,1,17,2021-01-03

GOOD or BAD: The Matrix Reloaded &amp; Revolutions (2003),"After the cultural phenomenon of The Matrix, two sequels were released in 2003. The Wachowskis returned to direct and thus we had The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions. Matrix Reloaded was one of the biggest box office hits of 2003 and received positive reception from critics. However, Revolutions saw a drop in box office and reception was more mixed. 

These days, the Matrix sequels aren’t as well regarded as the first movie, but I myself really enjoyed the Matrix Reloaded while Revolutions was more of a mixed bag even though it did have that great fight between Neo and Agent Smith.

Da 5 Bloods was a bad movie. I don't know why it is on so many Best Of lists.,"As I make my way through a number of Best Of lists for movies this year, I see a lot of people putting Da 5 bloods on their list. Am I the only one that thought it was terrible?

I felt like most of the plot and dialogue were taken right from 80’s Vietnam movie cliches. I thought many of the characters are not age appropriate for their parts (either too young or too old), and it is just too long. It felt like it dragged forever.

The flashback scenes to the Vietnam War were laughable because they didn’t even bother to recast the main guys with younger actors or even put in any effort to disguise their age. Chadwick Boseman plays the squad leader they lost in Vietnam and he is perfect in the part. The other four guys, however, still have gray hair and are in their 60’s+. It looks like a soldier and his four elderly uncles out playing war games.

Movies about Single People,"I'm looking for films about single people who are preferably past the age of 26. These characters would ideally be fine with being on their own, and it's not a story about, ""OMG I just got dumped and I'm gonna wallow for a bit and then go back out there and sleep with as many people as possible until I find the next Mr/Ms Right."" 

I'd prefer there be no dating at all and no ""love story"" with another person, whether it's mutual or imagined (Lars and the Real Girl, I'm looking at you).

I'm not talking about kids movies either, BUT if there are any kids movies (or animated) that adults would also enjoy, feel free to suggest it.

Basically I'm looking for something that's not sad or depressing, but more about a person who doesn't need to be in a relationship at this time and who chooses to be celibate. Maybe they were heartbroken in the past but now they're okay, and no one in their life is telling them, ""get back out there!"" So the focus would be on them having solo adventures, or improving their life, or bringing joy to other people.

Would prefer it's not about them reconnecting with their dysfunctional family in a reunion, either.

 Something I thought of is ""Nomadland,"" haven't seen it yet but I *think* there's no dating? Either way I'll watch it, sounds up my alley.",movies,1609540219,42improbabilities,True,1,25,2021-01-01

Black Panther is an awful superhero film.,"Black Panther is not only overrated, but one of the worst superhero films in cinematic history.The performances are laughably bad. Some of it's cast are great actors. Lupita Nyongo is a great actress, but her character is one dimensional and bland. Michael B. Jordan is horrendous as Killmonger that you may have been convinced that the villain was a whiny brat. And Chadwick Boseman's turn as the Black Panther is the worst of the bunch. His performance is one dimensional and his accent is laughable. Boseman is a very talented actor, but his talents are nowhere to be found here.But the bad acting I blame on the writing and directing which is just as bad.

Netflix has too many Christmas movies. I watched 20 of them this December,"My significant other and I found ourselves with a lot of time on our hands this Christmas, and since we both love Christmas movies we decided to watch as many of them as we could on Netflix. Some of them are old classics, others are new classics, others are pretty mediocre fluff, and still others are hot garbage. Inspired by [this post, rating Nicolas Cage DTV movies,](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/ffyvir/nicolas_cage_made_29_directtovideo_movies_in_the/) I decided to rate/review every one we saw. Here they are, in no particular order

&amp;#x200B;

**Let It Snow - 5/10**  Based on a John Green book, and it's probably way better as a book. There's just too many storylines to follow and not enough screentime to properly develop any of them, so every character arc is a bare-bones YA stereotype: the guy trying to throw a cool party realizes the cool was in his heart all along, the guy in love with his best friend finally works up the courage to make out with her, the cool one who's secretly lonely finds a friend, etc. Super predictable, but still made me feel warm &amp; fuzzy inside. +1 for the tinfoil hat lady.  

&amp;#x200B;

**The 12 Pups of Christmas - 1/10**  The acting is terrible and the plot makes zero sense, but this is a Hallmark movie so that's par for the course; what really ruins this movie is how unlikeable the main character is. She delivers every other line with a venom that does NOT fit a brightly colored, Hallmark Christmas movie about puppies. Would have been a 0/10 but the pups are just too darn cute 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Princess Switch - 6/10**   When a Christmas romance movie has ALL the tropes, it has to find a balance between taking itself lightly enough that the tropes don't feel generic and boring, while still taking itself seriously enough that the audience can feel good about getting invested in the story. *The Princess Switch* walks this line really well, and I was surprised how much I liked it. 

As with all Christmas romance movies, the plot is a juuuust little contrived (Vanessa Hudgens gets inspired to compete in an international baking competition after running into her ex-boyfriend, then happens to run into her doppelganger who is also a princess of a small european country with a Christmas-based culture and economy) But once you get past the exposition, a heart-warming love story ensues, with enough sincerity to make you forget about the dumber plot points. Solid movie.

&amp;#x200B;

**A Christmas Prince - 5/10**  *A Christmas Prince* leans a bit too far in the other direction. It is probably the most formulaic Christmas movie I've seen: girl with a kickass fun job in NY gets to go to a Christmas Kingdom for Christmas, and falls in love with a prince when she's not supposed to. Ditzy Mary-Sue protagonist who is somehow always right when the plot wants her to be? Check. Prince who's not sure he wants the responsibility of being king, but has his mind changed by *love*? Check. A palace intrigue in which the clear villain (the only character with dark hair) tries to steal the throne? Check check check! This movie has it all. And unlike The Princess Switch, A Christmas Prince plays it completely straight, which I think hurts it a little. But in the end, the movie knows what it is and delivers, which is more than I can say for its sequels. (We'll get to those later and hoooo boy are they something. hold onto your pants) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Christmas With a Prince - 0/10**  I think this is supposed to be a children's movie that Netflix forgot to label as such. The sets are all brightly multi-colored, the comedy is either slapstick or that weird brother-sister dynamic that you used to see on low-budget Disney channel originals, and every plot point is spoon fed to you so plainly that you can almost hear your mother making airplane noises. This movie wasn't just bad, it was so specifically bad that I'm pretty sure it's literally meant for children aged 8-14. But I watched the entire thing for you, the people. This post better get some upvotes.  

&amp;#x200B;

**A Muppet Christmas Carol - 11/10**   A true classic that I cheated in order to watch (I don't believe its on Netflix, but I had to see it).  I've seen this before when I was a kid, and watching it again it amazes me how good this is. Not only are the muppets their usual combination of funny and heartwarming, but their goofiness is perfectly offset by some chilling musical numbers and a truly gut-wrenching performance by Michael Caine. I honestly don’t know how he did this while surrounded by muppets the whole time, but he sells the more emotional scenes SO well. 

This movie has been inducted into the ""re-watch every year"" tier. If you haven't seen it, you should.  

&amp;#x200B;

**The Kacey Musgraves Christmas Show - 8/10**  Cheating a little on this one too, since its on Amazon Prime and not Netflix, but my significant other and I both love Kacey Musgraves too much to not watch this. It brings a nice retro touch to a year that desperately needed it, and it balances some classic, cheesy Christmas numbers with some dry segments in-between courtesy of Dan Levy. Also contains an original song, ""Christmas Always Makes Me Cry"", that fucking wrecks me every time I hear it. Its SO GOOD

&amp;#x200B;

**The Princess Switch 2: The Switchening - 3/10**   A hot mess that does not take itself seriously enough. Part of the fairytale ending from the original is destroyed in the exposition so that we can get a new and improved fairytale ending, except with an EVEN MORE contrived plot to get there, and a key character played by a different actress. Every fun gimmick from the original is dialed up to 11, and it's so over-the-top that it sort of clashes with the more sincere, lovey-dovey, happily-ever-after vibe that they're simultaneously going for. But it IS pretty funny, in a sort of 'so-bad-it's-good' way.    


If you have access to Netflix and don't want to watch the whole movie, just jump to 39:14. This one line had me rolling for a solid 5 minutes.

  

**The Knight Before Christmas - 1/10**  Apparently when Vanessa Hudgens saw critics saying that the plot to *The Princess Switch* was a bit much, she went ""they think *that* was contrived? Watch this!"" and then made this movie as an elaborate prank. At least I think that's what happened, because I have no other convincing explanation for how this movie got made.

&amp;#x200B;

**A Christmas Prince 2: The Royal Wedding - 2/10**   In the second installment of the Christmas Prince series, the central conflict involves our Mary Sue becoming uncomfortable with the uptight restrictions of royal life, and wishing more people would take her opinion on the Aldovian economic crisis seriously rather than relegate her to wedding planning.  


This one is just as basic as the original. However, because Mary Sue is already with the prince, the plot doesn't have a love story to lean on, and instead revolves around Mary Sue miraculously solving the economic crisis by discovering a sinister plot to undermine the government's economic initiatives. It's a weirdly boring intrigue for a Christmas movie, thrown into the foreground by the lack of a love story, and made even worse by the additions of comic relief characters Rudy and Sahil, whose entire schtick is just very exaggerated accents (and also Sahil being flamboyantly gay?) I know it's a Christmas movie and your audience is predominantly white, but come on. This movie was made in 2018, I thought we all agreed that was no longer an acceptable punchline.  

&amp;#x200B;

**A Christmas Prince 3: The Royal Baby - 1/10**   This movie introduced me to the Netflix Christmas Cinematic Universe, or NCU. It turns out that the Christmas Kingdom from this series, Aldovia, shares a border with the Christmas Kingdom of Belgravia, from the *Princess Switch* series. Aldovia's closest ally, however, is a nation called Penglia, and the third installment of the series sees Mary Sue try her hand at diplomatic relations when the royal family of Penglia comes to re-sign a centuries old treaty as is tradition. The plot is just as tiresome as *The Royal Wedding:* there's more palace intrigue, Mary Sue solves the case, etc. The exaggerated accents for comedy continue, with Rudy (Mary Sue's very Italian father who sounds like if pizza could talk) accounting for more of it this time. This does not make it any better.   


In addition to the bad plot and movie, I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the universe makes no sense. Penglia looks like the geographical equivalent of Georgia or Armenia (at least according to this map from the movie which bears a striking resemblence to how Europe looks in real life), but the Penglians in the movie are played by British Asian actors and bear traditionally Chinese? names. Also, there is still a New York City and a Chicago in this universe, so what happened in the past to get Europe to this state that would still allow for the formation of America? Do Great Britain and France exist in this universe? Does Italy exist, and if not, where did Rudy learn to make that food? More importantly, does Germany exist? If not, where does this Christmas culture displayed in the Christmas Kingdoms come from? Did either world war happen? Did Aldovia and Belgravia fight for the Axis in World War II?! I'm thinking about this too much, but I wish Netflix had thought about it just a little more.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Holidate - 4/10**  Not good at all. Rather than go for the cheesy and heartwarming type of rom-com, Holidate goes for a more laugh-out-loud, raunchy style of comedy. This *can* work, as evidenced by *National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,* but you need good comedic actors/actresses in order to deliver that type of comedy properly. Unfortunately, neither Emma Roberts nor Larry Hemsworth can really measure up to anyone in *Christmas Vacation*'s cast, and so a lot of the more ambitious bits (like the pants-shitting scene or the finger scene) fall really flat. And with no warm, fuzzy feels to rescue it, those comedic failures are right at the forefront and make the movie hard to enjoy.  


To rant a bit further, the casting for this movie is real weird. When trying for this type of comedy, it's bad enough to cast Emma Roberts (who plays the same jaded emotionless character in everything she does from *We're the Millers* to *American Horror Story* to *Little Italy*) alongside a relatively unknown Australian soap/action star with no comedy chops. But they also cast a talented SNL player, Alex Moffat, as the straightest of straight men in this movie, and THEN opt to cast a Vine star in a more comedic role. None of it makes sense, and it's just a mess.  

&amp;#x200B;

**Klaus - 10/10**   Incredible. I don't even know if I've ever seen a movie about the origin of Santa Claus before, but this movie has everything. Stunning animation, great character development for multiple characters, J.K. Simmons, and a heartwarming message about the spirit of good and giving. It hits especially hard right now, at a time in the world where it seems like everything is terrible; it's really nice to see a movie not only reminding us that Christmas is a time for giving, but that giving MEANS something, and can help make the world a better place.   


I'll be watching this movie every year as well. It's that good.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Christmas Chronicles - 7/10**  I'm kind of a sucker for movies with a more down-to-earth, human depiction of Santa Claus. The Christmas Chronicles delivers a pretty funny action flick starring Kurt Russell as Santa who has to interact with the normal world on Christmas Eve in order to fix his sleigh, recover his magic Santa mojo, and save Christmas. The kids are walking stereotypes (awful teen with daddy issues and too-cute little sister who still believes in Santa)  but in the end it doesn't matter because Kurt Russell steals the show. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really appreciated how his depiction of Santa was more human and less whimsical, without losing any of his Christmas spirit; it's a tough balance to pull off in these sorts of movies (see *The Santa Clause*  for an example of a lesser actor definitely NOT pulling it off) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Get Santa - 8/10**  I mentioned how I'm a sucker for a down-to-earth Santa? I'm also a huge sucker for ""Bad Santa who is totally done with everyone's bullshit"" tropes. It resembles *The Christmas Chronicles* in many ways, and probably inspired many elements of it, but with the addition of a really dry sort of humor that contrasts very well with the cheesy cheer you'd normally see in a Christmas movie (I think it's a British thing? I get *Death at a Funeral* vibes and I think that's one of the best comedies ever made).  

&amp;#x200B;

**The Christmas Chronicles Part Two: Electric Boogaloo - 6/10**  This movie is a real testament to why its important to keep things simple. The original works because there's only one major plot driver - Santa lost his mojo and needs to get it back. There's no weird villain with a crazy backstory, no awful CGI elves, and no convoluted origin story for aforementioned elves. All of these weird distractions really take away from part two, but in the end it's still got the core that made the original fun to watch: Kurt Russell's badass Santa saving Christmas (with the new addition of Goldie Hawn as Mrs. Claus which really works well). No movie that starts with Santa *hunting a giant saber-toothed lynx* can be bad, come on now

&amp;#x200B;

**The Holiday Calendar - 5/10**  An un-focused mess with a fun little love triangle, magical advent calendar, and Ron Cephas Jones. A lot of the side characters' motivations throughout the movie remain a mystery (why does her boss randomly fire her? Why does her love interest remain shy despite his incredible looks? Why is her short-term fling a douche one minute, but a sweetie the next? We may never know). But in the end it's sweet, and unlike most Christmas romance movies, the leads are actually attractive this time, so +1 for that 

&amp;#x200B;

**Christmas Catch - 3/10**  A Christmas action flick that doesn't really bring the cheer as much as one might like.  It's not terrible, but it definitely felt like another one of those shitty action flicks that just had a Christmas label slapped onto it at the end for marketability, which I didn't appreciate. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Jingle Jangle - 5/10**  This was the last one we saw, and it was the biggest disappointment of the entire month for me, because I was *so sure it would be amazing* and it turned out to be just OK. A diverse cast that includes Forrest Whitaker?  and Keegan Michael Key as a showboaty villain (the kind of role I think he was born to play)??  singing musical numbers about toymaking produced by John Legend??? set in a *magical steampunk world* ???!?!?!? Maybe I hyped it up too much in my head, but this had SO MUCH potential and squandered maybe of 70% of it. 

The musical numbers are really underwhelming once you get past the visuals. The choreo is incredible, the set design is incredible, and the voices singing the songs are really good, but the songs themselves are very repetitive and uninspiring, to the point that once you get past verse 1 + chorus you can and should fast forward through the next 3 minutes. If you saw this movie and thought the songs were good, try looking up the lyrics on genius and reading them with no music or visuals, and see if you still disagree with me. 

I also strongly disliked how they interwove the magic system with math; if you want to be whimsical, *don't include math.* The ""square root of impossible"" does not equal a person; because square roots are a real thing, and they aren't magic. Why not just make the magic *magical?* Why do there have to be equations involved? It looks pretty when they're writing in the air, but in the end it doesn't make sense. 

And that's really the theme of the movie: It's two full hours of stunning visuals, but take the tiniest peek behind those aesthetics, and you'll see it's all sizzle and no steak. And it sucks because I feel like if they just cut it down to 90 minutes, removed the math, and played only like 5 or 6 musical numbers but made them lyrically creative, the movie could have been a 12/10. I *really really* wanted to like Jingle Jangle, but it wasn't all the way there.",movies,1609549246,HalloumiA,True,1,8,2021-01-01

GOOD or BAD: War of the Worlds (2005),"Directed by Steven Spielberg, War of the Worlds was one of two Spielberg movies released in 2005; the other being Munich. It's based on the H.G. Wells novel of the same name and is the second theatrical adaptation of the story following the 1953 version. It stars Tom Cruise, Dakota Fanning, Justin Chatwin, and Tim Tobbins. 

I personally really like this one. I just love the spectacle of it all; from the [first appearance of the alien tripods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYGWG2_PB_Q) to [the ferry boat scene.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMw_xOuU9DA) It's just a really enjoyable, thrilling movie. Sure, some of the CGI looks spotty by today's standards, but the sets, sound design, and sense of dread elevate it. 

Speaking of dread, this movie has a great sense of paranoia and fear that plagued the United States in the wake of 9/11. The scene that best echoes is the moment when a crowd of people mob the car Tom Cruise and his family are in. It reminds of that Joker quote from the Dark Knight. ""When the chips are down, these people will eat each other."" It's just a stressful scene and you just want Tom Cruise to punch out all the people who are coming after his family. 

As far as negatives go, it's for the supporting characters. I like Tom Cruise as the everyman who wants to protect his family, but man Justin Chatwin is just an annoying whiner in this movie. And somebody at Fox thought this guy would be a good Goku?

There's also the part in the movie that takes in Tim Robbins' basement and while there was good suspense layered throughout this portion, I thought the designs of the actual aliens were a tad generic. They looked like leftovers from Independence Day.

Overall, while not Spielberg's best, War of the Worlds is still a fun movie I can watch every few years and get a good kick out of it. What do you think of this movie?",movies,1609549922,ggroover97,True,1,24,2021-01-01

Know what this movie is?,"A movie from the last century that I can't remember the title, can you figure out which movie it is by the descriptions below?

Descriptions:

1. A dance hall/bar during Nazi Occupation (Could be set in Paris)
2. The people Dance to the music
3. Almost zero dialogue, a dance/musical movie
4. Years go by from Pre-WWII--During WWII--After WWII
5. Clear anti-Nazi sentiment, signaling peace, love, solidarity, etc.
6. Story starts by displaying the jovial nature of the dance hall, then progress to the disruption and deadliness of Nazi occupation(Nazi officers come in and sit, they don't dance but to hit on girls but called out at last minute by a call), then the revelry of the ending of WWII, the dance hall returning its former glory.

What’s with all the remakes/reboots and sequels to long ago films nowadays?,"Not sure when it started but if i had to guess it was maybe around 2008 or earlier that the film industry started rebooting old franchises and making alternate timelines or time travel storylines and also making sequels to films that were pretty much finished decades ago. A recent example would be Bill and Ted 3.

I’m guessing the reason is they know it’s gonna make money but I for me personally even though I like seeing old characters return. It’s kinda sad seeing how old people are and it gets to a point where it’s just tiring. As in, we’ve already moved on can we come up with something fresh.

I watched a movie as a child and i don't know it's name. Also couldn't find any clues on the internet. Help me Please,"I can remember two scenes  


1- They were a family i think, and they were playing a tabletop game i think, the important thing is that they were like in a vacational house near a beach or something like that. Someone knocks the door but no one responds because the family was absorbed by the game, again im not sure of everything but i'm pretty sure about the beach house  


2- This is the best scene of the movie that i have in my head. The family is in a giant well (like a tunnel but vertical lol, my english is not the best) with very big black bricks. The bricks moved inside of the well making some kind of stairs that the family had to jump for climbing up.  


I know it was not a recent movie, maybe it's from 2010 or less, that's the only two scenes i can think of. i think it was something like jumanji with a tabletop cursed game or something like that

2602 movies &amp; 177 tv shows,"For the longest, I’ve wanted to talk about movies &amp; what an average collection of media someone might have. As I stated in the title, I have a pretty big collection of digital movies. Mostly all bought through iTunes, I usually try to find deals on them, but sometimes I rationalize myself into buying them at full price. I used to have around 400 movies in my collection, but those were physical DVD’s which could be stolen, or borrowed (never to be returned), scratched to the point they’d not play anymore, break or simply degrade over time. I feel like that was the biggest scam, when it came to having to rebuy a movie, since they just broke down, over time. 
  I’ll buy movies out of nostalgia, because my wife loves/likes them, someone in my family loves them, I think it may be a great watch, to finish out a series or in anticipation that my child will possibly like it, one day. Yeah, it’s an obsession. It’s an addiction. I can’t think of one day in the past 4 years, where I haven’t gone to https://www.blu-ray.com/deals/?category=ituneshd &amp; not checked to see what’s newly on sale or if the long list of movies &amp; tv shows I looked through, may have had something I didn’t see prior or something that may have caught my eye.

SPOILERS: Tenet Question/position re: Timeline of Neil.,"SPOILERS AHEAD!

I am having trouble &gt;!accepting Neil's timeline.  If the Opera House take over was on the same day as the large ""Tenet"" battle, that means that there were 3 Neils.!&lt;    I question that possibility.   There was one other time where &gt;!there were 3 of something, Right when the Protagonist exited the timestile.  at that point, there were 3 protagonists.   past/current protagonist, future inverted protagonist and future non inverted protagonist.      The timestile makes this possible.!&lt; 

In the Tenet battle, &gt;!the timestile gives us 2 Neil's.   1 that saves them, 1 that takes a bullet for The future protagonist.    The past/current protagonist is at the opera house/being tortured, who first was saved by Neil, and said Neil was inverted as we saw from the perspective of the current protagonist.   At the same time 2 other future Neils were simultaneously saving the future protagonist and at the ""Same time"" getting shot.   1 neil is in the humvee at the same time another neil is shot!&lt;     

I don't see how this is possible, &gt;!3 Neils essentially at the same time, 1 of which is in an entirely separate location.   Time travel doesn't mean you can bi-locate.!&lt;

If Tobey Maguire and Andre Garfield's Spider mans show up in Spider Man 3 2021 how much screen time do you think they'll actually have?,"Let's assume that the rumors that Tobey Maguire and Garfield will in Spider Man 3 are true. How much presence do you think they'll actually have? There's 3 possibilities.

1 They'll just have brief 10 second cameos. They'll just show up, say hi, and leave and won't show up again.

2 They'll appear about a quarter into the movie and interact with Tom Holland's Spider Man for the rest of the movie.

3 They'll just show up in the climax during a crazy action scene.

Dad doesnt want daughter go to France.
Within 5mins arriving in France shes kidnapped.

I mean cmon that's so lazy. At least could've developed on the early plot.

Such as the girls go the party then the guys drug them and take them away.

I can see the kidnapp itself is not a main part of the movie it's about liam Neeson getting them back BUT it just takes away seriousness from the movie imo.

An extra 10-20mins of scenes in paris would not have hurt at all.

For the life of me I cannot recall a movie with a 10 to 1 countdown for NYE. I did a little google search and found several movies that occur during or around New Years, but no specific mention of a countdown scene.

The Human Solution - Coming 2021 Trailer In Post Drama set in 1930-1950s but relevant today.," 

Hello r/Movies,

My lovely and talented wife is having a premier of her movie on January 22nd. Due to Covid it will be happening on-line. It is a drama set in the 1930s-1950s and deals with the sad history of involuntary sterilization of women... something we found out in 2020 is still happening in ICE detainment centers.

It featured an all female production crew. It was filmed in London but was edited right at our dining room table in Portland. Post Production sound was done just down the street from our house.

Please take a look at the trailer if you are so inclined, (link below) and if anyone has a podcast, or knows a journalist, dealing with these issues or with movies, she would love to have you get in touch. Thank You. Here are some words from her-

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t6qzp8udpe861.jpg?width=2044&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c9c6c15361378950a551fb1bac40427b02f50f8

I'm a Cuban-American female filmmaker whose 2nd feature will be released on January 22 via [**Laemmle virtual cinema release**](https://www.laemmle.com/film/human-solution) and I'm hoping you can help me get the word out. It's called *The Human Solution.* Trailer can be found [**here**](https://youtu.be/EQHQHOs8Bq8). Although this is not a doc, it's based on historical facts and could not be more timely.

Here's a bit more info for you:

In a 2014 interagency statement, the World Health Organization recognized that **coerced and/or forced sterilization** **is** ***a form of discrimination and violence against women***\*,\* and has been particularly insidious in targeting the LGBTQ community. This horrific practice persists to this day in many countries around the world, including the United States.

**Synopsis:**

Set in 1930s-50s Sweden, *The Human Solution* is a harrowing family drama about August Persson, a doctor and participant in the state eugenics program designed to ""improve"" society by sterilizing women deemed to be ""unfit,"" who reunites with his estranged wife and discovers she is pregnant by another man. August's life is turned upside down when his wife dies in childbirth, leaving behind a mixed-race baby girl.

Despite August's attempts to raise the girl, Elin, to be a proper lady, the intoxications of youth put teenage Elin in jeopardy with the authorities, and August must make a heartbreaking decision to fight against the system he's devoted his life to or to protect the young woman he's raised from birth.

Based on the true horrific history that sterilized tens of thousands of women in so-called progressive countries around the world, *The Human Solution* is a testament to the need to fight for women's rights and the inviolability of their bodies.

To note: *The Human Solution* had an all-female production crew, and every department head made exactly the same salary.

This is a tremendously important film about a persistent social injustice, and my **goal is to get as many people to watch as possible.**",movies,1609369903,dominator_13,True,1,15,2020-12-30

For me, I didn’t regularly start seeing movies in the theatre till I was 16-17 (so around 2004-2005). For me, being able to see Batman 89 in its opening night - that would’ve been wild as it broke many box office records. Also, one of my fave movies as a kid was Independence Day - watched it every time it was on tv. I’d definitely line up for that opening night.

Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) - How much Nazi technology did Howard Stark steal?,"I’m not a marvel or comic book guru, but I just had the thought while rewatching this movie.

As we all know, Howard Stark helps the USA in its war efforts against Germany during WW2.

As brilliant of a man as he is, his intellect seems outmatched by the German scientist Arnim Zola who is responsible for the technological advances of Hydra. We are shown this during the movie when Howard Stark inspects the submarine vehicle that was captured during an attempt of a German spy to flee with the serum. “We’re not even close to this technology.” he says.

During the raid on Hydra’s base to free POW’s, Arnim Zola is shown grabbing blueprints for his robot body design before eventually being captured.

Now, it’s we’ll know that the USA benefited from German technology that was captured at the end of WW2. Arnim Zola is now in the hands of the United States, with blueprints for the design of a humanoid robot. There are also numerous examples of Hydra soldiers outfitted with advanced suits. There’s no doubt that Howard Stark would have ended up working with Arnim on new technology after the war.

Is it just a coincidence that the man who worked with what I assume was the worlds leading robotics engineer would have a son that ends up developing the worlds most advanced robotic suit?

Is Iron Man’s powers the product of nazi technology?",movies,1609372961,CDNconstructor,True,1,8,2020-12-30
"Despite everything in 2020, I still managed to see 52 new releases in cinemas this year. Here are my thoughts.","I am extremely grateful to be living in New Zealand, where our government and public response to covid-19 has been incredibly strong.

Note, 15 out of the 52 were part of the New Zealand International Film Festival, which I have given its own section.

***

##**January** - 8 movies

####Little Women ★★★★
Jan 2nd - [Review](https://boxd.it/VoBKh)

Although I’ve never seen or read any other versions of this story, I found this to be a delightful adaption. I love that the filmmakers didn’t baby the audience, and I felt quite naturally told the story weaving through time. This genre of film is usually something my Mum would love and I would find a bore, but in seeing this film with my mother, the result was ironically the opposite.
  

####Jumanji: The Next Level ★★★½
Jan 4th - [Review](https://boxd.it/VEaxn)

I’d only watched *Welcome to the Jungle* for the first time the previous evening, and while I enjoy this world a lot and love the wacky performances, this film suffers a little from sequelitis, where they just go too hard over complicating the plot.
  

####Spies in Disguise ★★★★
Jan 10th

I thought this was just a really solid animated film. Nothing too emotional like a good Pixar flick, but ticks all the boxes for entertaining the whole family, and isn’t over commercialised like a lot of animated features frustratingly are these days.
  

####1917 ★★★★½
Jan 10th

This film struck me with its beauty, both in its technical achievement and its poetic storytelling. Saw this right when all the WW3 drama was happening in the news and was nervously hoping we wouldn’t be soon about to throw away all the peace that our forefathers had fought for.
  

####Dolittle ★★★
Jan 19th - [Review](https://boxd.it/X1Q7V)

Honestly don’t get why this film was so hated. It’s incredibly silly, but I think it succeeds at what it needs to be.
  

####The Peanut Butter Falcon ★★★½
Jan 19th

A neat and enjoyable little journey. I’m really glad Shia LaBeouf has found some cool projects to work on.
  

####Sorry We Missed You ★★★★½
Jan 19th

This film astounded me with its raw, emotive performances. I only felt a little under-satisfied when it ended with no real resolution.
  

####Bombshell ★★★★
Jan 19th

Really effective drama I thought. What surprised me the most was realising that all of this happened over a year before the Weinstein case. I feel it serves as a strong reminder of what has and undoubtedly still does exist among the industry today. 

***

##**February** - 7 movies

####A Hidden Life ★★★½
Feb 2nd - [Review](https://boxd.it/YjQEF)

I found this to be a very messy film creatively. It’s very long and it just doesn’t quite do enough to hold my attention the entire duration, but there’s enough in it that I can still say I appreciated it on the whole.
  

####Seberg ★★★½
Feb 2nd

Reasonably by the books in terms of filmmaking, but a really solid performance from Kristen Stewart, and something I quite appreciate after watching *Breathless* a few weeks later.

  
####A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood ★★★★
Feb 2nd

A much more moving and creative biopic than I was expecting, and informative for me considering I hadn’t yet seen *Won’t You Be My Neighbour* and knew nothing about Rogers.

  
####Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) ★★★
Feb 8th - [Review](https://boxd.it/YNn5h)

The title speaks for itself. This film is just trying to be a bit too much, but admittedly, also doesn’t suck completely.

  
####La Belle Époque ★★★½
Feb 15th

This film caught my eye in the trailers, but while I can remember enjoying it, unfortunately I can’t say I remember a lot about it, which makes sense given that in my diary entry I said it *“fails to leave a lasting impression.”*

  
####For Sama ★★★★½
Feb 15th

As I said in the notes of my Cinema Trips list, this film just shouldn’t have to exist. It’s an incredibly tragic tale that just makes me angry at the world for being so self serving.

  
####Guns Akimbo ★½
Feb 28th

Another movie that shouldn’t exist. I admit there are a couple cool moments of action and a funny scene with Rhys Darby, but in honesty it feels like quite a dangerous movie to be putting out into the world. Essentially the main character is an absolute arsehole nearing on incel, yet is shown to be the hero of the story with no growth whatsoever.

***

##**March &amp; April** - no movies! 😷

***

##**May** - 1 movie

####Bait ★★★★
May 23rd - [Review](https://boxd.it/1a0wc7)

An expertly put together feature that uses old film and sound recording techniques to make it feel like something from nearly a hundred years ago.
  
***

##**June** - 5 movies

####Rosie ★★★★
June 13th

What I described as “an unrelenting slice of life”. A very well performed, real feeling film which puts you in the shoes of people that you may not have known have such difficult lives.

  
####Deux Moi ★★★★½
June 17th

I think I have a bit of a soft spot for this film. I found it to be just delightful in every way. It’s sort of a sad/happy anti-romance, which feels rather relatable to me.

  
####Machine ★★★½
June 20th

A nothing special doco which lists off some ‘frightening’ implications of artificial intelligence. While there wasn’t a lot I wasn’t already aware of, I did find it interesting to ponder the moral questions that were posed.

  
####The Assistant ★★★★
June 20th - [Review](https://boxd.it/1d1HUN)

While this film was nothing like I thought based on the trailer, it was so much better. A highly relatable film that very accurately depicts the experience of someone in an entry level position in the film industry.

  
####The Invisible Man ★★★★
June 27th

Enjoyed this film a lot more than I was expecting. Didn’t feel too cliché and actually explored some really interesting ideas.
  
***

##**July** - 1 non-festival movie (10 total)

####Waves ★★★★★
July 22nd - [Initial Review](https://boxd.it/1godyv)

This film absolutely blew me away with its emotive filmmaking. I did however originally rate it 4 ½ stars due to the fact that right in the middle of the movie there is one extremely out of place, melodramatic scene that totally derails the pace of the film. Alas, upon rewatch, while I still totally hated that scene, I realised that the rest of the film is so damn good I still can’t remove half a star, and I now rank it among my [top 10 favourite films](https://boxd.it/31vF0) of all time.

##**NZIFF - July / August** - 15 films
These are the films that I saw at the New Zealand International Film Festival. I have a full list of my NZIFF watches [here](https://boxd.it/7uB1O), which contains more in depth notes on every film, although also includes films which I watched at home.

  
####Heroic Losers ★★★★
July 24th

A fun, tight knit heist movie. Nothing much else to say here. It’s A good popcorn flick for a rainy day.

  
####Corpus Christi ★★★½
July 25th

I thought this film was very well made and entertaining, but everything about it, from the language to the religious context, was all very foreign to me and I found it hard to relate to the main character.

  
####True History of the Kelly Gang ★★★★½
July 25th

Highly, highly recommend this film. I love its use of wacky filmmaking techniques which will have you question what it is you’re even watching. While it’s quite a long journey, it ultimately has a powerful message behind it.

  
####My Extraordinary Summer With Tess ★★★★
July 26th

A cute little film which explores some mature emotions through the eyes of a child. A pretty solid, uplifting family film.

  
####The Girl on the Bridge ★★★★½
July 26th

A really informative and powerful documentary about a suicide survivor whose life is now dedicated to helping others in NZ who are dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. Especially helpful for those that may not understand completely what goes on inside such a person’s head.

  
####Rūrangi ★★★★
July 26th

An NZ tale of a transgender man’s return to his hometown is informative and emotive. This was initially made as a web-series, and was recut into a feature film for the festival, and while it still retains its episodic structure, the overall serial structure fits that of a feature film perfectly.

  
####Exile ★★½
July 27th

A bit disappointing overall, as I quite enjoyed a lot of the small scale drama that the character went through, but it just ended sorta suddenly with little to no resolution.

  
####Relic ★★★★
July 28th

I don’t watch a lot of horror, so was naturally hesitant to seeing it, but ended up really enjoying myself. It was very well crafted and seemed to have some decent meaning behind it.

  
####LOIMATA, The Sweetest Tears ★★★★
July 30th

This is a documentary of a very personal story that feels almost wrong to be shared with a wide audience, but my regards go to the family for sharing. I had no knowledge of the context, as most of the audience at the time probably did, but the feature was well put together so I didn’t have too hard a time connecting with the story. Still would recommend reading just a little about it before watching.

  
####Before Everest ★½
Aug 1st

I hesitate to even call this a feature documentary. It’s so poorly made I was quite astounded that it was featured in the festival. It’s basically just some guy that was offended by something Ed Hillary said about his Dad, and sets out to make this pandering film to clear his Dad’s name... but the doco leads nowhere as he didn’t even find the answers he was looking for.

  
####The Truth ★★★½
Aug 1st

To be honest I barely remember this film. It’s mostly a conversational film, a little like *Before Sunset*. I remember enjoying some of the conversations but not necessarily becoming invested in the characters.

  
####The County ★★★★
Aug 1st

Unfortunately can’t remember heaps about this one either. Must have been reaching festival fatigue. I definitely recall enjoying much of it though, as it has a lot of subtle situational humour which I like.

  
####Ellie and Abbie (and Ellie’s Dead Aunt) ★★★
Aug 2nd

Competing with *Birds of Prey* for the lengthiest title of 2020, this film tries really hard, and I give it an A for effort, but unfortunately in my country an A is a mere passing grade. I really do enjoy the story they were trying to tell, I just wish they’d worked a little more to refine the script because it’s honestly a bit messy, and comes off feeling like a cheap student film. This story deserved more.

  
####Ema ★★
Aug 2nd

For those of you who like to ‘watch it for the plot’, this could be for you. However there really is nothing beyond that. I honestly couldn’t understand anyone’s character motivations or why the story moved in any of the directions that it did.

  
####Wendy ★★★★
Aug 2nd

An exciting end to the festival for me. I was expecting *Wendy* to just be another cheap attempt to reinvigorate an old Disney tale, but this incarnation of Pan &amp; company genuinely tugged at my four-year old heartstrings. It brought me back to a world I had forgotten, in a way which I never expected it to. More brutal. More honest. More beautiful.

####Tenet ★★★★
Aug 31st - [Review](https://boxd.it/1kwsQ7)

I both love and hate this movie. Also was so frustrated by the theatre’s failure to show this in the correct aspect ratio that I rewatched it again in another theatre the next day, but it was just too fresh for me to properly enjoy. Then saw it again in IMAX months later and enjoyed it a lot more, and strangely could hear the dialogue significantly better than I could in the Dolby Atmos theatre.

####The New Mutants ★★
Sept 5th - [Review](https://boxd.it/1l0qdR)

I had mostly forgotten that I’d gone to see this. I wish so much that this film had kept true to its original horror tone, and not ended with such a cookie cutter comic book climax. You can just feel how much the producers forced it to change... and for what?

####The Trial of the Chicago 7 ★★★★½
Oct 17th - [Review](https://boxd.it/1poSlN)

Whenever I can, I love to catch Netflix movies in theatres. I just love that experience so much and it was absolutely worth it with this. I knew none of the context before seeing this film so found it highly captivating and educational. It was interesting however, to read afterwards about the liberties it takes with the story. I’ll agree that in some cases it did feel a little too Hollywoodish.

  
####Baby Done ★★★
Oct 22nd - [Review](https://boxd.it/1pXb9p)

I’d actually be very interested to hear what international audiences think of this Kiwi film, if it ever comes your way. My main issue is that it draws too much from the Auckland comedy scene, which I don’t personally vibe with.

  
####Babyteeth ★★★★½
Oct 30th

The third great Aussie film from this year. You folk across the ditch are doing some great stuff. This is a highly performance driven, emotive film, delivered with some delightful camerawork and cutting.

####Savage ★★★★
Nov 2nd

The best drama to come out of NZ this year. Really nicely shot and well structured, with solid performances all around.

  
####Reunion ★★★½
Nov 21st - [Review](https://boxd.it/1t9Doj)

Eerily similar in tone to *Relic*, this NZ horror effectively elicits emotion, but just falls short for me with the flow of its story.

  
####Mank ★★★½
Nov 28th - [Review](https://boxd.it/1tWCuN)

Like with *Citizen Kane*, I found myself enjoying many parts of this film but remaining uncaptivated by the story overall.

##**December** - 6 movies

####The Mystery of D.B. Cooper ★★★★½
Dec 5th

Truly fascinating and very well structured film documenting some of the possible ‘D.B. Cooper’ suspects, with some surprisingly chilling evidence. If you know nothing about the only unsolved hijacking in American history, I’d highly recommend watching [Lemmino’s short documentary](https://youtu.be/CbUjuwhQPKs) first, and if that intrigues you, it could be worth checking out this film too.

  
####The Midnight Sky ★
Dec 20th - [Review](https://boxd.it/1wpwmJ)

This is one I wish I had watched on Netflix cause then I could have turned it off halfway through.

  
####When A City Rises ★★★
Dec 22nd - [Review](https://boxd.it/1wSRlF)

I was intrigued to see a documentary about the rebuild of my hometown of Christchurch, and it’s mostly a reasonably well structured doco, but unfortunately isn’t quite as well made as it could have been and the narrative does feel slightly skewed in one direction.

  
####Wonder Woman 1984 ★★½
Dec 23rd - [Review](https://boxd.it/1wOTBx)

This feels like a film where no one could agree on where the story should go, so they all compromised and just had little bits of the story they wanted. From the bloated unnecessary opening sequence, to the *Spider-Man 3* villain problem, to just completely glossing over Steve’s reentry into the world, this film just reeks of creative clashes between the director and producers, most of which probably happened after filming and not before, resulting in a script that could have done with about six more drafts, and a film that feels like its had its guts ripped out in the edit.

  
####Nomadland ★★★★½
Dec 26th

This film has a really natural feeling that I love. From its performances to its cutting, every beat flows and feels like the natural passage of time, telling a very sweet story of this melancholic, and courageously stoic character.

  
####The Painter and the Thief ★★★★½
Dec 26th

One of the most fascinating stories I’ve ever seen, told in an equally fascinating manner. I was so invested in the characters that I was quite sad when it ended and I didn’t get to see how far their story went.

GOOD or BAD: The Cable Guy (1996),"Directed by Ben Stiller, this movie has nothing to do with Larry the Cable Guy but something else entirely. Starring Jim Carrey and Matthew Broderick, [The Cable Guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vm-kQh4zvaA) was notable for its dark tone, which was different from Carrey's work like Ace Ventura or Dumb &amp; Dumber. 

Due to this, audiences and critics at the time were divided on it including Siskel &amp; Ebert. Roger Ebert called it one of the worst  movies of the year while Gene Siskel called it Jim Carrey's best since The Mask. Even so, people thought this movie would kill Jim Carrey's career. 

Over the years, Cable Guy has garnered a cult following. I myself really enjoyed the movie for its dark tone and Carrey's performance. It was different and bizarre but that's why I like it so much. Maybe audiences weren't ready for this kind of movie at the time. What do you think of The Cable Guy?",movies,1609373790,ggroover97,True,1,37,2020-12-30

"An Alternate 2020: What The Biggest, Best And Otherest Movies Of 2020 Could’ve Looked Like","This is a post I decided to make because I find trivia like this so interesting: which actors were almost cast in what roles etc, and speculating on whether they would’ve been good, bad or maybe even great in those roles, as well as seeing the different creative minds that could’ve told the stories in a completely different way. This is a list of movies from 2020 with some trivia about ways they changed in their productions. Hope this is as interesting to you as it was for me to research. I did something similar on r/Oscars and r/oscarrace with Oscar nominated and winning roles in the past as well, which is worth looking at if you’re interested in that stuff too. Anyway, on with the list. 

**Artemis Fowl** - The movie spent 19 years in development hell, with various directors attached at one point or another including Lawrence Guterman (who was pushed out through a petition) and Jim Sheridan, who would’ve cast Saoirse Ronan as Holly Short. 

**Birds Of Prey** - Numerous actresses were considered for the roles of Huntress and Black Canary: actresses considered for Huntress included Alexandra Daddario, Jodie Comer, Blake Lively, Vanessa Kirby, Sofia Boutella, Margaret Qualley &amp; Cristin Milioti, while potential Black Canaries included Janelle Monae &amp; Gugu Mbatha-Raw. Justina Machado &amp; Roberta Colindrez were both considered for the role of Renee Montoya, and Sharlto Copley was considered to play Black Mask. 

**Bloodshot** - David Leitch &amp; Chad Stahelski were once attached to direct the project, and Michael Sheen was initially cast as Dr Emil Harting but dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. 

**Da 5 Bloods** - The film started life as a spec script entitled *The Last Tour* by Danny Bilson &amp; Paul DeMeo, set to be executive produced by Mike Bundlie &amp; Barry Levine and directed by Oliver Stone, who dropped out in 2016. Following this, producer Lloyd Levin sent the script over to Spike Lee &amp; Kevin Willmott, who altered it significantly, including shifting the focus of the film to an African-American perspective and adding the flashback sequences. Samuel L Jackson, Denzel Washington, Giancarlo Esposito and John David Washington were then cast in unspecified roles (I would speculate Denzel would be Paul and JDW his son), but all dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. 

**The Devil All The Time** - Chris Evans was originally cast as Sheriff Lee Bodecker, but was forced to drop out due to scheduling conflicts, recommending Marvel best pal Sebastian Stan to take his place. 

**Dolittle** - Nicolas Cage turned down the role of King Rassouli, which went to Antonio Banderas. Also, Randy Newman was originally going to score the film, as a reference to his uncle scoring the original Rex Harrison version. 

**Extraction** - According to IMDb, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger were attached as leads on this project at one time. 

**The Father** - Florian Zeller has been quoted as saying that if Anthony Hopkins had turned the film down, it likely would’ve become a French production, as Hopkins was his only English choice for the role. 

**I’m Thinking Of Ending Things** - Brie Larson was originally cast in Jessie Buckley’s role. 

**The Invisible Man** - A version of this film has been in development since 2006, when David S Goyer was hired to write a script, who remained attached to the project until late 2011 when news of the project fizzled out. The project was famously revived as part of the ambitious *Dark Universe*, with Johnny Depp set to star in the title role in a film scripted by Ed Solomon. However, this was dropped after the critical and commercial failure of *The Mummy*, Universal changed strategy and decided to focus on telling standalone stories with their famous horror characters, with this being the first example. (Still kinda wanna see Javier Bardem as Frankenstein’s Monster though, I will be honest)

**Mank** - The film was originally set to be Fincher’s follow-up to *The Game* and was set to star Kevin Spacey and Jodie Foster, but development was halted due to the director’s insistence on filming in black and white. 

**Money Plane** - Tom Arnold and Tom Berenger were both considered for the role of The Cowboy before Matthew Lawrence was cast. 

**Mulan** - The film began development in 2010, with Chuck Russell set to direct and Ziyi Zhang in the title role. Ang Lee was also offered to direct but turned it down. 

**The New Mutants** - Early versions of the script included some characters from previous *X-Men* films, including James McAvoy’s Professor X, Alexandra Shipp’s Storm and an unspecified Colossus (presumably the one from Deadpool but I don’t know for sure). Also, Nat Wolff was in the running to play Cannonball, and Rosario Dawson was set to play Dr. Cecilia Reyes. The alien mutant Warlock was set to appear, with Sacha Baron Cohen in talks for the role, but was cut due to budgetary concerns. Also rumours were abundant of a Mr Sinister appearance, with Jon Hamm and Antonio Banderas rumoured at one point or another. 

**The Prom** - Ariana Grande was originally set to play the role of Alyssa, the closeted cheerleader, but was replaced with Ariana DeBose due to scheduling conflicts. 

**Rebecca** - At one point, this film was set to be directed by Nikolaj Arcel and written by Stephen King. 

**Scoob!** - Dwayne Johnson, Chris Pratt &amp; Ryan Reynolds were allegedly considered to play Fred, Bryce Dallas Howard, Karen Gillan and Anna Kendrick were considered for Daphne, Jenny Slate and Awkwafina were up for Velma and Jason Lee, Justin Long, Bill Hader, Patton Oswalt &amp; Jack Black were considered for Shaggy. 

**Sonic The Hedgehog** - Brad Bird, Paul Wernick, Rhett Reese, David Berenbaum &amp; Phil Johnston all submitted drafts to Sony at one point for a Sonic movie. Also, numerous actors were considered to play both the title character and Tom Wachowski: candidates for Sonic included Dylan O’Brien, Freddie Highmore, Josh Gad, Andy Samberg, Bill Hader, Will Forte, Jim Parsons, Charlie Day, Dane DeHaan and Adam Devine, while Jack Black, Ed Helms, Owen Wilson, Chris Pratt, Chris Evans, Jake Johnson, Michael B Jordan, Bill Hader (again), Jason Segel, Justin Timberlake, Adam Pally, Paul Rudd, Ansel Elgort and Milo Ventimiglia were all reportedly considered for James Marsden’s role. 

**Sound Of Metal** - The film originally began development with Matthias Schoenaerts and Dakota Johnson in the main roles, being replaced by Riz Ahmed and Olivia Cooke respectively in July 2018. 

**The Trial Of The Chicago 7** - The development of the film first began in 2007 because of Steven Spielberg’s desire to make the film, with Sorkin writing the script with the intention of Spielberg directing. Walter F Parkes &amp; Laurie MacDonald would have produced with Spielberg, and Sacha Baron Cohen was cast as Abbie Hoffman (crazy that he still ended up with the role 13 years later). Other actors considered for the original production were Will Smith as Bobby Seale and Heath Ledger as Tom Hayden. However, the WGA strike caused the project to be delayed and eventually stall production, with Spielberg then departing. Sorkin was then said to be working on the film with Ben Stiller in 2008, and Paul Greengrass in 2013, who exited the project due to budget disagreements. Spielberg then encouraged Sorkin to direct the project himself after watching Molly’s Game, and Sorkin agreed, due to the sudden timely relevance of the film. During the 2018 development, Jonathan Majors and Seth Rogen were the actors who were cast then replaced, with Majors cast as Seale and Rogen cast as Jerry Rubin. 

**The Witches** - Actresses considered for the role of The Grand High Witch at some point during production include Claire Foy, Uma Thurman, Kate Winslet, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Charlize Theron, Rachel Weisz, Kristin Kreuk, Salam Hayek, Keira Knightley, Natalie Portman, Kate Beckinsale, Charlotte Riley, Natalie Dormer and Jennifer Lopez. Also, interestingly, producer Guillermo Del Toro thought the film should’ve been made in stop motion. 

**Wonder Woman 1984** - Emma Stone was allegedly first offered the role of Cheetah but turned it down, with Sarah Paulson expressing interest in it before Kristen Wiig was cast.",movies,1609376458,adalby12,True,1,1,2020-12-30

When Vader goes, how come he doesn't disappear like other Jedis do? Luke ends up burning him on the fire at the end. My first thought was maybe because he had lost his Jedi ways. But isn't the title itself, Return of the Jedi, referencing Anakin and his redemption? If that's the case, him disappearing would have been very poetic. 

Do you guys know of any reasoning of why he wouldn't have disappeared? Or is this just an inconsistency?

"Movies/shows about cults, rituals","Looking for movies or tv shows, about cultists and rituals. Few examples: in movie [As Above, So Below](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_Above,_So_Below_(film)) there is part where protagonist deep inside Paris catacombs see some people doing ritual, in movie [Eyes Wide Shut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_Wide_Shut) scene when protagonist is walking in mansion during sexual ritual, in [Ritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ritual_(2017_film)) there is a lot of dark pagan cult stuff, in show [True detective season 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective_(season_1)) whole story is about ritual killings and yellow king cult/lore, in movie [Witch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witch_(2015_film)) in the end there is witch ritual in middle of dark forest, in Warhammer 40k lore there is cult of chaos who fits my theme too. So kinda looking something like that, dark, mysterious, related to some cultist activities, rituals, set in dark places.

Please dont suggest any political, terrorism related cult shows, im not interested in cults where people sit in room and plot how to overthrow some political party or smth. Also dont suggest pure religious stuff like Christianity, Islam or other major religion fanatism where people sit in some camps and some preacher talks how good is his god and how can he heal them.

Someone please explain the attempted hit on Frank Pentangeli from The Godfather II,"From what I understand, the Rosato brothers attempt to kill Frank Pentangeli.  

The hitman says ""Michael Corleone says hello"" prior to strangling him.  As we all know, it's a botched attempt, because the cop walks in the bar, and everything goes to shit, resulting in FP surviving, but heating those last words, thinking Michael ordered the hit on him.  This leads to FP deciding to testify against Michael, feeling betrayed.

Now bear with me....this never made sense  to me, because why would the hitman say that, if FP was supposed to die? Why make him think it was Michael if it really won't matter.  However, it seemed to have made the story fit, as since the hit is botched, they've now turned FP on Michael.  Was this planned?  It seemed to convenient that the statement and the botched hit worked out so well.

To add even moooore confusion, there was a thread in r/moviedetails that stated the line ""Michael Corleone says hello"" wasn't even in the script, but improvised by the actor.

So....if the line isn't said, and FP survives, what makes him think Michael tried to kill him? And if it is ssidz and FP dies, what's the point of that line?

Instead of using Computers, they instead decided to use forced perspective to pull this effect. In fact, CGI was never used outside of the shots of Buddy and Santa. Despite the movie's over-reliance on particle effects and detailed Production design, even with inflation, the movie costs half the amount a live action blockbuster kids movie with mediocre visual effects like Goosebumps or Pixels.

And today I finally got around to watching WW84, and found the effects too be so fake and cheap looking. However, despite costing 200 million to make, even with inflation factored it **relatively** cost about the same as the budgets of Jurassic Park and The Two Towers combined. Both with CGI that has stood the test of time. 

It wasn't until recently discovered that it wasn't until about 2010 when budgets for these types of movies seemed to skyrocket. If you look at a list of the most expensive film of all time, the majorly of movies mentioned were made in the past decade!

Why is this?

I find it odd that with film equipment becoming cheaper than it's cheaper it ever been in history.,Why have blockbuster movies become expensive to make despite the visual effects looking no better than they did ten years ago? 

I mean, how is it possible that a gorgeous game, The Last of Us part 2 costed only 10 million more than Joker(2019), which was considered a "" Low budget movie""?

Because it's not like visual effects animator are well paid, in fact, their incredibly underpaid, and Visual effects companies often go bankrupt in mater five years or so due to the way the system works by not paying the effects company if the scene goes longer then it was originally planned, there are reshoots and delays, or last-minute changes to the film or if the studio wants them to redo the effects they just did. 

So why are blockbuster movies so expensive these days?",movies,1609379212,SnooBananas720,True,1,31,2020-12-30

The Last Jedi is the greatest Star Wars movie.,"For me, The Last Jedi is better than The Empire Strikes Back and A New Hope. Like a lot of Star Wars fans who grew up with Luke Skywalker as their hero, I too had initial issues with a defeated and depressed Luke who had decided to withdraw from a galaxy in need. But the broader message about failure and how to respond to it as well as the bigger questions about legacy and how to avoid the mistakes of the past are worth the cost of taking Luke's character to this place. I think The Last Jedi is groundbreaking, daring; and helps to solidify Star Wars as relevant to the issues facing us in the 21st Century. The movie takes risks instead of being a generic rip-off of A New Hope like The Force Awakens was. It's a masterpiece and one of the greatest blockbusters in cinematic history.",movies,1609379893,randomspawner,True,1,55,2020-12-30

Most anything with Vin Diesel is just terrible.,"Some of Vin's early movies were actually pretty decent, and if you only watched anything he's done in the last 10 years  you'd think he is a terrible actor. However, in some of those early films, he delivered his character flawlessly. 

I don't know if it's his ego or what, but somewhere along the lines of his careers he forgot how to act and really just started to douche. I can name dozens of scenes in everything from The Last Witch Hunter, to cringe moments in his bread and butter, The Fast Saga, but one that comes to mind is the Bloodshot and the last XXX.

That scene where he's working out after finding out he's been mutated or whatever, it just doesn't even make sense. XXX OG was pretty dumb, but atleast dumb entertaining, but the latest one is so terrible. I just wish Vin would stop being a douche because he *can* act, but chooses not to.

"[Serious] To be American: Minari, the Golden Globes, and my personal thoughts about this HFPA decision","To those of you who don't know, here's a link to the situation as of last week: https://variety.com/2020/film/news/promising-young-woman-golden-globes-drama-1234871836/


A quick tl;dr for the article, basically the Golden Globes refuses to consider Minari as a contender for Best Picture but rather Best Foreign Film because Korean is the dominant used language.


When I read this, the first thing I thought was ""Saw that one coming,"" and moved on. But this article bugged me throughout the week, pestering me and caused me to get riled up more and more as time passed. Why? The more I pondered upon the stupid reason why it can't compete in Best Picture, the language issue, the more I realized how angry I should be.


I'm a Korean immigrant, brought to the States when I was a kid. While growing up, I never realized how disassociated I was from my Korean heritage and predominantly white, black, and Hispanic community. As a kid, I was oblivious to racial, socioeconomic, and cultural differences between me and my peers; that was something I never noticed or cared for. But I quickly learned through growing up and changing school that who I was in context of American society, and why I was different. Why I never felt like I had a solid identity, or felt like I truly belonged anywhere.


One of my defining moments in high school was when I got my American citizenship at the age of 18. I don't know what happened, but something clicked; it felt like I was free. For years I was torn between being a either Korean or Korean-American, or American. I never fully sided with my heritage (definitely no mastery of the Korean language here) but was not totally American (as I didn't have any rights as a citizen). But man, the moment that my parents informed me of that news, I recontextualized my entire life for the first time, and understood that this was an American life, and I was an American.


So when Minari came out, while the environment was different, the context and characterization of the story actually represented me. Me. For the first time in 21 years did I find a movie that I could actually relate to. Whenever I saw an article or post about proper representation in media, I always sympathized for those communities that these films proudly displayed. But it wasn't until Minari did I actually cry up a bit and realized that this was a film that immigrants like me could fully conceptualize and recognize; it was one of the ultimate tales in the American Dream. 


Seeing the parental characters attempt to create a nurturing environment for their children while also having them keep a hold of their heritage, the brother that wants to be more American than Korean, and the overall living situation/family dynamics/community engagement that these Koreans struggle with; it is a testament to how anyone can see this film as anything but American. 


With this context and realization at hand, I became furious. How dare some fucking committee decide that Minari is a FOREIGN FILM just because it is in a language other than English? Even if you watch the trailer, you realize that this isn't a film made by Koreans for Koreans on the peninsula, but directed by an American for Americans as a recognition, celebration, and accomplishment of the fight we have experienced for generations. This is an experience and tale told through thousands, millions of lives, moving past ideas of nationality, color, or race. It is one perspective told of the definition of the American Dream, one perspective that represents the hearts and souls of me, my family, and my people from across the sea. 



We are American. And this is our story.

Why is everyone so upset about the body-swapping subplot in Wonder Woman 1984?,"I see lots of people being morally outraged that when Steve Rodgers re-appeared in the body of some strange man that is was non-consensual (the body-swap *and* the fact that WW and 'Steve' had sex). Lots of accusations that WW and Steve Rodgers are 'rapists' 'body snatchers' and 'using his body for sex'. 

The movie was filled with nonsense plot holes and cheap visual effects - but I'm surprised so many people got caught up on this particular detail. Which begs the question  'Since when was a body-swap *ever* consensual?' It's always slightly sexually problematic (ex: protagonist looks down pants to see male/female/larger/smaller genitals + comment) but nobody ever *agrees* to a body-swap. Even in 'Big' it's a situation of 'be careful what you wish for'. Also, it is an incredibly over-used TV trope and nonsense-supernatural plot device - how come you all seem so surprised to see this *in a movie*? Sure, it was surprising that it was poorly explained and happens all of a sudden (and why did they even need another man's body for Steve to 'possess'?) but it makes as much sense as any other dumb Freaky Friday scenario. 

The strangest thing is the fact that people seem offended on behalf of the nameless man who's body is supposedly being taken/possessed/swapped/raped. Can't you just enjoy a movie without being outraged about the sexual agency of a fictional, walking plot device? He's not even a character in the film - the man exists so that Steve can have a body (again, why doe he need someone else's body? It's magic!) AND this is not an actual real-life problem that needs to be addressed. I know that we live in the Me Too era but you don't need to call out the sexual politics of a completely fictional, supernatural scenario. If you are worried that you or a loved one are going to get possessed by Chris Pine and raped by Gal Godot - then maybe you should be the person writing these movies because your life sounds more incredible than anything in the entire DCEU.",movies,1609197398,pussy_petrol,True,1,32,2020-12-28
Zodiac. 2007 movie.,"Zodiac is so underrated, nobody talks about it. The characters, the real story, the thrill, acting, screenplay, everything about it was balanced perfectly. I watched it again, felt the same magic.
  

Starting from the first minute, till the end, this movie takes you on a ride, the thrill that something will happen now, every small detail feeling essential, was something that glued me with the screen, a masterpiece. Jake Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downey Jr. did full justice to their character, the chemistry between them sounded perfect. The movie overall was a perfect blend of thrill, retro touch, the costumes, the methods, music and felt like a true audience engaging master class.

Her (2013) is absolutely incredibrilliant," Finally getting some progress on my movie bucket list and this morning I decided to give Her a chance.

 I stumbled upon this film because I was checking out the list of films leaving Netflix and this one showed up. I've heard of it before and to be fair outside of Joker I've never seen anything with Joaquin Phoenix in it. 

 What a fantastic film, completely solid all the way around. Scarlett Johansson completely stole the show for me. She felt SO REAL in that role. Did anyone else think she kinda sounds like Rashida Jones? 

 I'm not sure how to describe it but watching the film and his acting, I felt the same level of awkwardness, discomforts and joys that Theodore Twombly (played by Joaquin Phoenix) goes through in the movie. It's really impressive to essentially have him act out so much emotion and he's basically alone most of the time. I imagine there was a real voice talking back to him when he was filming his scenes alone (otherwise that would just make it even more impressive). 

 Of course Joaquin Phoenix is on another level as well, he’s quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. He really nails the whole nerdy/broken/introverted kinda vibe and he presents himself as emotionally vulnerable a lot which makes the ending even more painful. 

 It's the first movie I've seen that deals with an AI where there's no ""human body"" attached to it which I think really allowed it to explore situations that haven't typically been dealt with before. For example, what is sex in a relationship where you can't physically be with the person? 

 The soundtrack was another bright spot. I mean come on: Moon Song + that amazing post rock in the final scene that spills into the credits? Incredible. 

Another theme that gets touched on is the evolution of AI. Throughout the movie much like the relationship, the AI Samantha was evolving. Usually in movies that deal with AI it quickly goes in the direction of the ""AI evolves and turns against human"" plot that one would expect. This movie focuses on the first part for sure. And I think Scarlett Johansson did a great job humanizing the AI which is not something I was expecting.

It also deals with the pervasiveness of technology in our lives and how lonely it can be once you're essentially sucked in. Even perhaps more relevant this year given the amount of social isolation many people have had to go through and how much we've come to rely on technology for just about everything. An interesting development in the real world is how much more sophisticated sex dolls have become. I can't help but wonder what the real world would look like if an AI like Samantha existed and it could be attached to a ""body"".

As a side piece of trivia, Joaquin Phoenix's ex-wive (in the movie) is played by Rooney Mara. They have both been in a relationship since 2016 and just got engaged and had their first kid in the last year.

Anyways, if you haven't watched this film and have Netflix, it's going to be removed on Jan 1. Highly recommend it.

If you have watched this film before, do you have any other films that are similar or like it that you might recommend?",movies,1609198192,ean6625,True,1,4,2020-12-28

Heaven's gate (1980) and its critical reassessment,"A lot of controversy surrounds this movie, due to its high budget it caused the bankruptcy of United Artists and some claimed it ended the era of New Hollywood as movies were put back into the hands of producers and not directors which is kind of depressing since nowadays its just studio driven movie remakes.

It was critically panned at the time as a pretty terrible movie, partly due to the bits of the movie being recut multiple times at the behest of producers which made parts of the story non sensical and pointless.

However, recently the director's cut has received critical re-evaluation and has even gotten praise for its cinematography and its portrayal of the American West. Some critics called the original 80s cut \`the greatest injustices of cinematic history'. Its re-evaluation is probably also connected with the films themes and depiction of class warfare, immigrants and xenophobia which have left quite a mark on public discourse this past decade. 

The story is loosely based on the Johnson County War where rich American cattle ranchers hired armed gunmen to kill the (mostly) Eastern European settlers in Johnson County due to suspicion of cattle raiding. The American president had to get the US Cavalry involved in order to save the hired killers from the settlers. The whole thing basically showed that the American Dream didn't apply to the new settlers.  

Personally I liked the director's cut of the movie, it shows the Wild west in a more realistic way than other Westerns. The acting is solid from Walken and Kristofferson, the cinematography and sets are amazing and the directing of Cimino has its moments. The main story was okay though I didn't really care much for the whole love triangle part. It does still cover the basics of searching for the American dream (the gate to Heaven) and its ultimate failure.",movies,1609198342,a_bsm_lagrangian,True,1,4,2020-12-28

Dirty Harry (1971),"I hadn’t seen this before last night when I watched it, but I’m glad I did because I quite enjoyed it. Great performance from Clint Eastwood of a character I grew quite fond of despite him almost being designed to be unlikeable. The story as a whole is also investing and engaging. As good as Eastwood is, Andy Robinson as the villain might be even better. Not only does his performance sell the villain as a slimy and deranged but dangerous individual, I actually found it legitimately creepy at times, which really adds to the tension of the film nicely. 

The score is mostly standard, but there’s some nice uses of a choir at key moments that I thought were pretty cool. My main problem is the cinematography. For day scenes, it’s perfectly serviceable. But night scenes are very dimly lot to the point that it becomes difficult at times to tell what is going on. 

Also, I don’t know if &gt;!having him throw his badge away at the end!&lt; was the right call. I know the filmmakers have explicitly stated that they didn’t mean to imply that &gt;!he was quitting!&lt;, but that’s how it came off to me and I don’t think it totally works. But as a whole, I thought this was quick the engrossing police thriller, and I look forward to seeing the four sequels, although I’ve heard they vary in quality. What are your thoughts on this one?

"This past weekend, I watched Die Hard 2 and 3 for the first time. Not sure which is better but DH2 doesn’t seem to get the credit it deserves.","A few years back I watched Die Hard for the first time during Christmas week. For some reason I put off watching the rest of the series until this past weekend. I have HBO Max so I watched Die Hard for Christmas then the following 2 the next 2 days. 

I read and watched reviews and rankings about this series without spoilers. It seems like Die Hard 2 is usually the least preferred of the trilogy. It also seems like DH2 is often only ranked above Die Hard 5, which is universally known to be the worst. I read somewhere that the trilogy was the actual Die Hard series with Die Hard 4 and 5 being Bruce Willis action movies that happened to be titled Die Hard. 

After watching the trilogy, DH1 is still the best and my favorite, but I’m not sure I’ll join the popular opinion that Die Hard 3 is better than DH2. What DH3 does better is that it has a better villain who gets a great [soundtrack bit](https://youtu.be/x8Rj7x4_zRo) (though DH2’s villain was good enough), doesn’t have an annoying asshole cop/G man that opposes McClane the whole time (Lorenzo in Die Hard 2 was so annoying), Zeus was a great addition as a fellow main protagonist, and in general, DH3 shakes up the formula more. 

A lot of people not only rank DH2 towards the bottom of the series but also think it’s just a mediocre action flick. I still like DH2 a lot as an action film and think it’s great. It might be too similar to DH1 for some, but I appreciate the continuity. It feels more like a continuation than DH3 does. Like DH1, DH2 is also Christmas themed, takes place mostly at night, and brings back several characters who are in similar roles (I liked that Powell was back but disliked how he was barely in it). DH3 is good but seems a lot different from the first 2, taking place mostly in daylight, it’s not Christmas themed, and no one except McClane returns. I know the differences are what they were going for though. DH3 also has a more abrupt final battle and ending. Not as satisfying as DH2’s imo. And is it just me, or does DH3 have the least amount of McClane screen time of the trilogy? 

Perhaps DH2 is too similar to DH1, even down to using the same Christmas song at the very end, but there are enough differences to be valued. 

Now for it not getting enough credit. Well, it was released only 2 years after DH1, so it’s surprising that it’s even as good and big as it is. This year was its 30th anniversary, and unless I missed it, I didn’t really see a whole lot of attention brought to it like DH1 had for its 30th anniversary 2 years ago. DH2 is the only other Christmas film of the series, yet it doesn’t really seem to get the attention most other Christmas films get during the season.

Was/is DH2 viewed as too dark and bleak? Admittedly, it’s the darkest and bleakest of the three films. The villains are the most evil and brutal of the series, and that is shown through the people they kill.",movies,1609199875,1random_redditor,True,1,16,2020-12-28

"Dunkirk is a very different war movie, and I enjoyed every second of it.","Firstly, it deserved all its Oscars for audio editing/mixing and montage. This looks beautiful.

With that out of the way, I loved how there was little fighting and battle scenes. I’m used to movies like Saving Private Ryan, Hacksaw Ridge and so many others that present a lot of scenes of infantryman gunfights that seeing just ONE scene (in the beginning, no less, right before Tommy reaches the shores of Dunkirk alone) was very surprising!

The movie mostly focus on the desperate measures the soldiers take to try and get on a boat home and they don’t really fight throughout the movie. Most of the fighting is presented in the shape of the two Spitfire pilots sent to assist in the evacuation of the troops, and I was on the edge of my seat for all of the dogfights.

I think the pacing is a bit janky, the movie cuts back and forth from the various perspectives of the characters, but I could follow what was going on nonetheless. In fact, it made those scenes more satisfying and tense, knowing the details of what was at stake. 

I know the movie is 3 years old, but I had to share how much I enjoyed this movie. It was very different from all of the war movies I’ve watched so far, given its setting.

Wonder Woman 84 is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Slight spolier,"One scene for me sums up exactly how bad this film is and everything that is wrong with in it. 

Diana and captain kirk are able to waltz into an air field and jump in a jet.  Leaving aside the fact that there's a jet just sitting prepped for take off with a full tank, this jet then is able to fly to Egypt.

Its nearly 10k km from Washington dc to Cairo but this jet manages to fly there,  and back no less, without needing refuelled.  Even accounting for somehow getting it refuelled in Egypt, its not flying 10k km.

Theres also the point about making it invisible to avoid radar. That's not how radar works Paty  the object is still there and still traveling and the radar will still be bouncing off the plane.

After making a big deal of your dad being a pilot, you'd think the jet scene would be at least a tad realistic.

Let's not even go there with the fact that a guy from ww1 knows exactly how to fly a fighter jet from the 80s.

Why have there been so many penises in recent movies and tv shows?,"Serious question: why have so many recent movies shown penises?

The Lighthouse, Midsommar, and Euphoria are examples of content that featured cameos from penises, and I wonder who it’s supposed to appeal to. It’s safe to say literally no one wants to willingly see penises in movies. 

I know many filmmakers are gay/bi/lgbtq+, but I think the average person would be disturbed, or at the very least, annoyed with having to see penises frequently in films. 

Some of you might mention how many straight men willingly see penises in porn. However, porn serves a purpose to be erotic and get guys off while they masturbate. No one masturbates to non pornographic movies. And, men tend to be in an alternate state of mind while they whack their little friends. 

Many films I’ve seen in the past 3-4 years have had a man’s penis in full view. It seems like penises are being used for shock value. There is no artistic merit in nudity, male or female.

Lost In Translation is amazing.,"I had my honeymoon in Tokyo 2 years go and it all still feels so fantastic and familiar yet weird to me, and Sofia captured that so well. The cinematography is amazing as is the script, they really got a down to earth, casual, chance meeting to feel so meaningful and beautiful. 

Out of his films I've seen, this is my favourite of Bill Murray's. He is just fantastic playing a funny, insomiac, possibly depressed bloke who is going through a difficult time in his life. And Scarlett Johansson, what a damn good performance at such a young age. Their casual hang outs are such good fun and then the juxtaposed hotel room/bar scenes are sublime and emotional as you can see the struggles they are both, at the same time, sharing and hiding from themselves in a way.

But that ending, I saw it a first time a year ago and loved it but seeing it tonight and really feeling it after feeling liked I've aged 10 years in 2020 it really pulled me in and I was crying like a little bitch once they kissed and said goodbye.

Another Interstellar thought about the time slippage...,"Before they go down to Miller’s planet, they have a discussion about using time as a resource and how much potential time they may lose going to Edmunds and Mann’s planet first. 

I realize they also mentioned fuel and food as a resource so that is to be taken into account. 

I’m wondering why they never tried to further go into the math of visiting the other two vs 7 years for an hour on Miller’s planet. Yes, an hour of time for 3 of them saves a ton of food and fuel and there’s no way they thought they would’ve gotten trapped, however it took 14 months to get to Saturn which is over a billion miles away(on average) from us. So how far away was Edmunds planet? 

On top of that, if they were thinking of a return journey, wouldn’t it be easier (physics-wise) if they came back towards the black hole after coming out of it with enough velocity to apparently be out of its pull?

The Illusionist (2006) - flaws in the film's execution (Spoilers for both the Illusionist and The Prestige),"I wanted to discuss some flaws in the Illusionist that stood out to me. My gripe isn't with the story itself, but aspects of the execution. Tell me what you think. 

Conceptual Flaws 1 and 2: The magic and the reveal  
The joy of magic tricks is in knowing that there is no magic, and wondering how the illusion was practically created. The film illustrates this with Inspector Uhl's character, who is enamored with the orange tree trick.

However, the film robs us, the audience, of this enjoyment of Eisenheim's tricks by making so many of them genuinely impossible. The film tries to present Eisenheim as a traditional magician while also creating ambiguity over whether or not his magic is real. This creates a problem where we are not wondering ""how did he do that?"", but are instead wondering ""what is he supposed to be doing?"" (as in 'is this supposed to be ""real"" magic or a trick in the context of the story?').  
\- The orange tree trick was based on [a real magic trick](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLtSEAttBYU) by Robert Houdin (Houdini named himself after Houdin). However, the trick in the film is CGI and is not possible as shown.   
\- The locket that Eisenheim makes for Sophie is also impossible, and two different locket props were used for it. (If it were real, the photo could not have remained squarely in between the two twisting halfs of the heart)

\- the slow orange drop from hand to hand was a special effect.

\- the upwards drop was a special effect. 

\- Obviously the sword trick was special effects/acting.

\- The ghost tricks were cgi and weren't possible as depicted.  
The film also seems to suggest at one point that Eisenheim thinks magic is real--when Sophie begs him as children to make them disappear, the camera zooms in on his face as he strains, which seems to communicate that he is trying to make them magically disappear. As an already accomplished magician, even teen Eisenheim should know that magically disappearing isn't ""real"". 

An adult Eisenheim later tell Sophie that there are no true mysteries- no true magic- before they enact their escape plan.   
However, after this point, Eisenheim's necromancy is depicted ambiguously as real magic. 

So, when the end the movie is like ""psych it was just an illusion all along!"", it falls a little flat, because we already knew that Eisenheim didn't believe in real magic, and therefore was likely never conducting actual necromancy. We knew he was a magician. However...we also never got to learn how he did his stage tricks. So the tricks were CGI, and we never got to learn the mystery behind them, which made them...not very compelling?

No one explains what happened to Uhl at the end. He just kind of...realizes everything? *We even see flashbacks of sequences that Uhl had no way of knowing about, even though it is all supposed to be his personal revelation.* 

I know the following has been done to death, but let me compare to the Prestige:   
   
Every trick in the Prestige is genuinely possible as depicted, with the exception of tesla's duplicating machine, which is explicitly depicted as ""real"" magic. There is no ambiguity to the audience: even though Angier refuses to believe it, Borden's trick is just a trick performed with a double, while Angier's trick is made with the ""real magic"". Throughout the movie, we wonder *exactly* how Borden does his trick so well, while also *knowing* that it is grounded in reality.    
We never see much of Borden's life, so the mystery around him lingers until the reveal.   
When we see flashbacks that reveal Borden's trick, *they are an illustration of information that is being directly told to Angier, who is having the realization.* They are not random flashbacks to inform the audience of information Angier would have no way of knowing.   


Flaw 3: The editing.

There are some strangely edited parts of this film. After the sword trick, right before the duchess leaves Eisenheim's presence, there is a second or two of slowed-down footage, which seems entirely unmotivated. I genuinely paused and re-watched that part because at first I thought it was an error with my playback. I noticed it happen in maybe 2 other places in the film, where there seemed to be some almost randomly slowed down frames. ([Here](https://youtu.be/osb_Fklz5ag?t=343) is the clip on youtube, but it is at 240p, and at that quality it is hard to see the slow-mo)  
Also, when the film does slow-mo, it's just 24fps footage slowed way down--not a higher framerate played back at 24fps. I'm not sure why they did this, but it gave it a very amateur look, while also not really helping the audience see what is happening. For example, the slowed shot I mentioned above could have been replaced with a lingering shot of the duchess's stare, to greater effect. When the Inspector opens the locket, the low, slow framerate results in motion blur that does not help us see what happened any more than real-time playback would. 

  
I know that the film is supposed to be sort of from the inspector's perspective, which could explain the ambiguity of the magic, but the film shows us too much of Eisenheim's POV for that to be effective.

Just finished watching Its a wonderful life for the first time. One of the best Christmas films ever.,"I've heard a lot of good things about this film, but had never got round to watching it over the years. I thought it was too old and can't be that good. Boy was I so wrong. It's Christmas Eve and I heard this film took place on this day so I decided to watch it. 

The cinematography, acting and music was amazing.  George did really change the lives of so many people, he just couldn't see it. The film makes you reflect on your own life. Keep your loved ones close and don't lash out on them when you're having a bad day. If you're going to kill yourself, think of how many people this will hurt. The film really sends a strong message home. I am happy to consider it one of the best Christmas films.

However as I’ve grown older, I now prefer to watch movies in the way they were meant to be seen, and that includes the language they were originally made in.

I don’t dislike dubs, it just feels like something is off. I watched the dubbed version of Castle in the Sky on HBO Max and it just felt unnatural. It wasn’t bad it just felt off.

Toy Story 4 came out a year and a half ago—and regardless of what Reddit or the general audiences think of it—it still got glowing reviews and is the best critically reviewed Pixar movie since Inside Out; Coco on the other hand also got fantastic reviews and is actually better reviewed than any Disney Animated movie (excluding TS3, TS4, Inside Out) in the past decade. Even Finding Dory and Incredibles 2 (which a huge number of reviewers actually liked it as much as the first or more) got pretty good reviews as well. Like we get it, Soul is great.

"Robert Zemeckis's ""A Christmas Carol"" Is unironically my all time favourite Christmas movie.","I am not very big fan of Christmas, so it make sense that my favorite Christmas tale is one that isn't even about the holiday, it takes place during the holiday, but it's about the futility of life and the impacts we have on those around us.

 We all like to beleave that we have all the time in the world before that black train comes for us, poetically enough, right when we're ready to look it in the face is it comes barreling down the tracks, it's already right behind us ready to sweep the rug beneath our feet.

I've seen quite a few iterations of the original Charles Dickens tale, but for me personally the 2009 animated film starring Jim Carrey tops the rest.

 I don't know, it seems like this version and this version alone takes extra steps to make it seem the most nightmare inducing, the most realistically horrific.

The surrealistic style of the motion capturing definitely helps the atmosphere, it also helps that Jim Carey's acting is just ever so cartoonish that it pushes it outside of the realms of uncanny Valley, So it doesn't need to befall the same fate as ""Polar Express"".

Weird Brother Bear promo art,"When Brother Bear first came out in theatres, there was a 3D cardboard cutout on display at the Kirkland Colisée (in west Montreal) as part of the promotional art. 

Up close, it looked rather innocuous with the two main characters, the smaller bear sitting on the shoulders of the other with the cast of secondary characters surrounding them.

From a distance, it looked like something super freaking lewd and pornographic. I actually did a double-take and gasped; don't know if anyone else saw what I did at the time, nor would it be possible to know... until now!

I am looking for the title of a German language vintage film (maybe mid 20th Century) about a whole village of children suddenly disappearing overnight from their little town. I think a witch kidnapped them and imprisoned them in her huge gingerbread house. Eventually they break free, kill the witch and return to their village. It seemed like a semi-horror film, with lots of gore and dark themes but toned-down horror.

The political story arc of Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy,"(All of the following, including how I talk about the Joker’s origins, comes from my subjective interpretations of these films.)

Batman Begins:

Thomas Wayne, a good-hearted capitalist, does his utmost to try to solve Gotham’s poverty (almost bankrupting his company in the process). He fails because ultimately, the system doesn’t allow for the needs of the lower classes to be priotitized over the drive for profit. Then when a random act of violence that arguably resulted from this socioeconomic inequality leaves Wayne’s son Bruce an orphan, Bruce eventually seeks out the ability to fight the kinds of injustices that took his parents. But the group he gets training from comes to the utterly nihilistic conclusion that Gotham, due to its systemic contradictions, should be destroyed through a mass poisoning. This total collapse of the system is averted through Bruce’s unshakable idealism, but the socioeconomic inequalities and structural injustices remain. And the idealism that allowed Bruce to avert the humanitarian crisis has also made him hold onto faith in the system, and to continue his life as a billionaire who helps perpetuate the system.

The Dark Knight:

The Joker-who I think we have good reason to believe is a war veteran who took this path in life as revenge against the system that sent him to war-is determined to prove Bruce/Batman’s faith in the system wrong. He does this by manipulating the symbol of the city’s law enforcement system Harvey Dent into joining the side of nihilistic villainy, and by attempting to corrupt Bruce/Batman. (Which he fails at in that he doesn’t get Batman to kill, but he succeeds at in that he gets Batman to utilize an unethical Patriot Act-esque surveillance system.) At the end of the film, the image of law enforcement (and by extension the ruling institutions which prop up the existing socioeconomic system) are maintained, but only through a lie.

The Dark Knight Rises:

Bane does what the previous two big bads have also done: use the contradictions of Gotham’s social and economic systems as an excuse for wreaking mass destruction and chaos. He exposes the lie that kept up the narrative of a legitimate law enforcement system, and he points to the city’s economic inequality as justification for secretly trying to blow up the city. Again, this nihilistic philosophy that the system’s injustices warrant destroying everything is repudiated by Bruce/Batman’s idealism. But despite Bruce’s giving up his mansion to provide shelter for the underprivileged, the system remains entirely intact in the end. Neither the trilogy’s villains nor the trilogy’s heroes have solved the problems that helped produce all of this tragedy and chaos in the first place. If anything, the system is now ideologically strengthened due to the relief that the masses feel after Bane, with his non-solutions to capitalist injustices, has been defeated.

Batman did the best that he could to address the injustices he encountered, but only within the confines of the social role that the system led him towards. His job wasn’t to lead a constructive revolutionary vision in opposition to Bane’s, it was to stop the system’s contradictions from blowing everything up.",movies,1608862689,CommunistRedditor,True,1,2,2020-12-24

The Social Network Review (David Fincher Film),"-The Social Network was released in 2010 to widespread critical and commercial success. The film was even nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, and Actor for Eisenberg. The film would win for the Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, and Best Film Editing categories respectively. In 2016, The Social Network was generally hailed by 117 international critics to be the best film of the 21st century. I agree with everyone one of those critics. The Social Network was one of those films that feels more relevant now than it ever was in 2010. Facebook has been subject to countless violations and lawsuits, which was represented in front of the eyes of many viewers ten years earlier. Mark Zuckerberg is played to extreme precision by Jesse Eisenberg (in his best role). Jesse plays Mark with an awkward and arrogant exterior, but that's all a facade for a much more menacing interior. Jesse was definitely snubbed that year and I couldn't see anyone else playing Mark. There are moments in the film where I honestly felt that Jesse as Mark was more humor than Mark actually is in real life. Andrew Garfield is also great as former CFO, Eduardo Saverin. As the film goes on, I feel that Eduardo is definitely the more sympathetic character as he is slowly squeezed out of his position at Facebook. It's a very nuanced performance and I think he even deserved a nominated, especially for his rant against Eisenberg towards the end of the film. The most surprising bit of casting has to go to Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker. Since I wasn't too familiar with Timberlake as an actor, his performance in The Social Network is really exceptional. Timberlake really embodies the has-been attitude of Sean Parker as he tries to leech his way into Facebook. Another great pair of performance come from the Armie Hammer who plays both of the Winklevoss Twins. Armie is incredibly convincing, and I never thought for a second that I was looking at Armie and another actor with Armie's face digital placed on theirs. Besides the incredibly performances, The Social Network also has some of the most masterful cinematography I have ever seen. Every scene has this beautiful modern aesthetic that makes the film completely times less. The strong attention to detail like the formulas on the window and the Harvard websites are so well-done, and they fully capture you into the entire mise en scène of the picture. To accompany the beautiful visuals, Aaron Sorkin wrote an intelligent and dialogue driven masterpiece of screenplay writing. Every string of dialogue pulls you into the film even further, especially every line said by Eisenberg. Lastly, I have to mention the simplistic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Rose. The score is minimal, but incredibly effective, and it fully pulls you into the modern aesthetic Fincher pulls off masterfully. After the film was released, there was a bit of debate on the accuracy of the film and since the film wasn't consulted by either Zuckerberg or Saverin, (but he did consult the writer of the novel the film is based on) that has led many to criticize some inaccuracies. I love the film regardless, and I think that how the story is told through a nonlinear narrative and the effort put into it, outweighs the accuracy criticisms. I love The Social Network and I think it's one of the best films of the 2010s and a relevant representation of the Facebook empire. The Social Network definitely gets a 10/10!

How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) shaped the sense of humor of a generation,"My partner and I weren't feeling the holiday spirit this year, so we threw on How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000). I remembered how hilarious that move is, and in reflection, I think that this movie shaped the self-deprecating, spontaneous and pessimistic sense of humor of my generation (Millennial/Gen Z era). Great writing, and Jim Carrey absolutely kills it with his performance.

Mission Impossible 3 review,"What another great movie, Mission Impossible 3 is another action movie with an incredible score and good characters with a pretty decent story that almost made me shade a tear or two. Ethan hunt is an amazing character, Tom cruise is just incredible, every scene he is in was just amazing. The action in this movie was the best action out of the 3 movies so far, and the team of agents were so good. The villain Damian with the Rabbits Foot was so complex, compelling, and smart. Philip Seymour Hoffman does a wonderful job playing him, he is so convincing and probably my favorite mission impossible villain yet. The script of the movie is very scary and has you on your toes from act to act. Great Action just kept coming, Ethan wife is another decent character, but what made her a good character and not a Damsel in Distress is that fact that she saved Ethans life at the end. The first act was so good the action on the bridge with the highway was just incredible, cars blowing up and, guns firing. Everything that Tom cruise did in this movie was incredible, he is Ethan hunt and nothing more. I was so gald at the end when Ethans wife actually didn't die, like I thought she was, but the way they tricked me into thinking she was going to die was so complex. Another scene that really had me on my toes was the last act of the movie with the fight between Ethan and Damian. Overall a good movie, and a incredible missions impossible movie. I give it a B++ and a 7.2 out of 1/10",movies,1608864636,EntertainmentBoy,True,1,11,2020-12-24

Specifically they both have scenes where fans flash the main characters from the stands and also the fact that both movies have a plot point that the protagonists have to learn how to drive backwards and then end up using it to win a race later in the movie.

New method to separate the junk for the gold.,"So I have watched many movies all those years... noticed that at about 2010 and upwards things in the movie industry got downhill... lowest common denominator rushed out scripts scenes reboots of reboots of reboots etc... 

And I found myself on netflix where I already watched the few good movies that it has right now so I am in a hopless journey of going through the dozens of junk movies it has only to be able to fill the home screen with thumbnails to give you an illution of variety. 
                                   


But hey... one of them might actually be interesting.. who knows? That's why I am keeping on this journey! :P                               


During that I discovered a very nice effort that will save me some time! 


What I do is open a movie that I dont know / or my gut tells me it will be junk or boring and then on an other tab I open a game of chess :P (something that interest you it doesnt have to be chess you just could read some news feeds or whatever it doesnt have to be sound invlolved though e.g watching youtube videos)           
        
If in the first 10 to 20 minutes  I just hear some rumble and my brain doesnt even want to pay attention to the dialogues or is curious about what happens in the movie (which I cant see but is still playing on an other tab so I can hear it) then it means that the movie is going to be junk and I leave it....


Seriously if movie producers could just do that before finishing their junk we would either have less such movies or better ones eithercase the movie scene would be better :P 


P.S so why don't I just watch 10-20 minutes of a movie without doing something else? Well I am a compassionate guy if I watch it I will try to ""give it a chance"" and say hey maybe the next scene will be promising, maybe the plot will become better etc... but it doesnt and I end up watching the hole thing... 

If the movie is polished and good/interesting enough to catch my attention while hidden and me playing chess then it probably wont have what it takes to be a good movie :P  It's things you only subconsiosly notice like the background sounds and/or music or the quality of the acting voices (yes actors need to train their verbal skills as well) etc you watch the movie and you miss those blunders but if you do something else and still not notice a movie is playing means that all those things are bad... on a good movie something will catch your ear or imagination (like WTF was that sound?  or why did she asked him that? or wow something cool is happening)",movies,1608506293,papajo_r,True,1,12,2020-12-20

Why was Wonder Woman received so much better than Captain Marvel?,"They're both each of their company's flagship female superheroes, the first big female superheroes in this golden age of cinematic universes. 

Their first movies were somewhat divisive: Wonder Woman's third act is widely criticized as a bad CGI extravaganza, and Diana becoming almost a co-star to love interest Steve Trevor earned some derision as well. Captain Marvel is considered a needless throwback to the MCU's more bland origin stories, with an egregiously overpowered main character that lowers the stakes. 

Wonder Woman has two movie appearances more than Captain Marvel, though it can be argued that her portrayal in the terrible Justice League might have represented a step back for the character. 

And yet, there's no doubt that Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is more popular and more well-liked than Brie Larson's Captain Marvel. Is it just politics? Larson is one of the most hated celebrities on the internet, true, but Gadot is not a stranger to online criticism either. 

I believe it ultimately comes down to their performance. Larson may be an Oscar winner but she was, in my opinion, woefully miscast as Carol Danvers. She's a far better actress than Gadot in a technical sense, but she's missing that charisma or spark that Gadot brought to the role of WW. Furthermore, I believe Larson had the additional misfortune of playing a character that was never really well-defined by the writers/directors. In contrast, Gadot is a fairly limited actress but Patty Jenkins knew just how to harness that kind of charisma and personality that Larson lacks into a likeable performance that suited the character.",movies,1608506625,HerewardTheWoke,True,1,70,2020-12-20

Better movie: Trick ‘r Treat (2007) or Krampus (2015)?,"Both of these movies are directed by Michael Dougherty and are holiday-themed horror movies. Both have incredible atmosphere with Trick ‘r Treat’s Halloween aesthetic and the frozen isolation of Krampus. I also really appreciate the practical effects in both movies with CGI being used when only needed. 

In terms of story structure, both are different. Trick ‘r Treat follows a vignette format with many stories taking place on Halloween night. These stories also happen to cross paths. 

Krampus is more centered on the family which is being stalked by the titular Christmas demon.

Ride a Crooked Trail (1958)-A charming and funny film that inescapably reminds me of a certain First Couple,"Now, I don't mean to get overly political or present sides in this forum.  I'm a little ways into this really great movie starring Walter Matthau as the town Judge, and a supporting cast I don't know.

Without spoiling to too much, it's about a case of mistaken identity, a genre I adore, and this one plays it exceptionally well.   In summary, a bank robber is mistaken as the new Town Marshall, and to save himself, he presents his accomplice as his wife.  Everyone is determined to believe this 'fine young man' is the great marshall they need to set the town straight-but all he and his 'wife' want is to rob the bank and flee.

Matthau is unforgettably strong character that let's his hopes fool him, and the townsfolk are too used to following his lead to question anything.  So, I hope some others will chime in if they've seen it.  I never have, and 33 minutes in I'm hooked.",movies,1608513098,CleanReserve4,True,1,0,2020-12-20
Is anyone else completely losing interest in movies without cinemas?,[removed],movies,1608513116,VeryConfusedOne,True,1,2,2020-12-20
Without cinemas I am completely losing interest in watching movies,"I honestly don't care about watching movies anymore and don't even want to see the movies I was looking forward to. It's hard to explain what I'm feeling, but I guess a lot of you must feel the same.  

The very fact that I know a movie didn't release in cinemas makes it seem boring to me. It doesn't even matter that I wouldn't have seen it in the cinema - if I know it was released directly on disc or streaming, I'll feel like it didn't matter. And therefore I can't really get into it. 

Imagine if Avengers: Endgame was released directly to Disney+ now. How lame would that be? People would talk about it for a week or two and then nobody would care anymore. I want movies to be big events and I want people to talk about them for a long time. I want them to feel special. With so many of them being released to streaming they just blend together and lose relevance a few days after release.

When I'm looking at Metacritic or IMDb I now see so many movies that absolutely nobody would've cared about if they hadn't been in cinemas. And I'm also seeing a lot of movies that nobody cares about that would've been highly-rated if they came out in cinemas. It's actually really sad. 

I'm pretty sure now that all those Netflix movies people find ""meh"" aren't actually that meh. They're just meh because they feel irrelevant because they've been released online only. I always thought it was weird how specifically these movies aren't that well liked, and I honestly pin this on nothing but the format they've been released in. It has little to do with the movies themselves. Even the great ones, like The Irishman or Uncut Gems are only talked about for a very short time before becoming irrelevant.

Right now I'm at a point where I've almost completely stopped watching movies. Streaming completely takes the magic out of movies for me. It feels so wrong. These films weren't made for this. Movies were something special for me. Now they feel like nothing more than elaborate internet videos. And it makes me really sad.",movies,1608513178,VeryConfusedOne,True,1,14,2020-12-20

Poltergeist wasn’t very scary and had annoying supporting characters 

Gremlins is a horror comedy that isn’t funny or scary and with mostly dull acting (Tremors and Arachnophobia are better examples of horror comedies)


Goonies plot was a bit too ridiculous and the constant yelling and talking over each other by the kids was almost unbearable

Let’s talk about Die Hard (1988),"I understand that this is a wildly popular movie, and I totally understand the appeal! 

But.... 

Upon watching it for the first time I was quickly under the impression that this movie was so loved for its value as a “campy” film. Much like Tommy Wiseau’s The Room.

Guys, despite being entertaining, this is a bad movie. 

The characters constantly make terrible decisions, and everyone acts as a caricature of themselves. To be clear, this is fine if the movie is tonally consistent, but it takes itself far too seriously and doesn’t seem aware of just how ridiculous every action made is. (Again similar to The Room)

(It is very well shot and directed) 

Do you all enjoy this movie for its camp value, or is it genuinely viewed as a good film?

2020 is the first year since 2007 with no Billion Dollar movies - Could 2019 be the last?,"With only 10 days to go in the year and Wonder Woman's ugh.. poor performance in the international box office,it got me thinking.

With all the moves that WB has made to move into the streaming world, it seems like the future of the industry is resting pretty much on the back of Disney, if it wasn't already. For now, they seem pretty committed to keeping things in theatres (much to everyone's surprise I think), but I was wondering what the next billion dollar film might be (if theatres can survive in their current form).

Universal might be able to clutch it with a well placed Fast and Furious/Jurassic World film (which are both upcoming), but if they fail to capture the eye of audiences, it's very unlikely. Sony would be next with either Bond or one of their Spiderman properties, but coming off a lukewarm reception to Spectre and never quite reaching the billion dollar mark with spiderman before, I think that's equally unlikely. Paramount could be a dark horse with Transformers, however I believe their next movie is in 2022. 

Now this basically leaves Disney, in which case I believe you can write off all of their 2021 MCU films. To get people back out into theatres globally, the vaccine is going to have to be rolled out practically worldwide before we can get anywhere close to numbers we were seeing pre-pandemic, so I think the MCU movies might just be able to ramp us up to the best chance at a billion dollar movie next year: Avatar. 

It's always said that you shouldn't underestimate James Cameron, and with two of the three highest grossing films of all time under his belt, you can see why. He might really pull it out of the bag with this new Avatar film, and with people raring to get back into cinemas (and hopefully hot off the heels of some great MCU momentum), I think it has the best chance of becoming the next billion dollar film, and the only one to achieve the status in 2021. Potentially it could be the last ever billion dollar film. 

After that point, who knows.",movies,1608517823,_DeanRiding,True,1,17,2020-12-20

Is Funny Games (2007) the most self-righteous movie of all time?,"Ok, so since I can already predict what the top ten comments are going to be, let me just say it now.  I *get* Funny Games.  I understand what it's attempting to do.  I understand that it's supposed to be a commentary on torture porn horror flicks like Saw, that deconstructs the genre by refusing to show any of the gore, thereby leaving the audience unsatisfied, and forcing them to grapple with the question of why they wanted to see it.  And on the surface level, I actually kind of like that concept.  I love a good subversion of tropes or a genre deconstruction.  But Funny Games' lofty aspirations are in my opinion utterly dragged down by its arrogant, pretentious writer/ director, Michael Haneke.

Michael Haneke strikes me as a man who cannot refrain from letting you know how much smarter than you he is.  Like the annoying kids in high school who would pretend not to have heard of popular celebrities so that they could feign superiority over all the other dumb, plebian masses.  To thoroughly deconstruct a genre or effectively subvert a trope takes an intelligent artist.  I know it's been said before, but No Country for Old Men is a brilliant modern deconstruction of westerns and crime thrillers.  It's a film where the good guy just abruptly dies off screen, the bad guy just walks away, and the rough and tough Texas ranger comes up empty handed.  It's all handled with enough subtlety and nuance to flip your expectations on their head, without telling you that you're an idiot for having those expectations.

I'll say it again.  To properly deconstruct a genre requires a talented artist.  To make something like Funny Games takes a self-righteous hack who took their freshman year philosophy class and now thinks that they're smarter than the entire world.  Funny Games is a film that will regularly flip a trope on its head, and then go the extra step of having the characters explain why you, the viewer, are stupid for expecting that, often literally having characters speak directly into the camera to do so.  The idea of not showing any of the gore or violence happening is actually kind of a brilliant concept.  But then Haneke will simultaneously pat himself on the back and spit in your face by having one of the killers turn to the camera and say ""what, were you expecting some good blood and gore?""  Another egregious example comes when the killers say that they're going to make the wife choose how her family dies.  One of them then turns directly into the camera and asks ""What do you think we should do?  Oh, you want us to let them all live, right?  You're already on their side.""  I can just picture Haneke sitting at his desk writing this and going ""Jesus Christ, I've done it.  I'm the first genius auteur ever to realize that in movies, audiences tend to root for the good guys.  I'm so fucking smart.""

And don't get me wrong, there are plenty of things in this movie that *could* have been done well.  Like the killers not having any motives or backstory.  I honestly liked the moment early on in the movie when the wife asks one of them why they're doing this, and he responds ""why not?""  But then Haneke feels the need to beat you over the head with this point by writing a self indulgent scene where one of the killers gives himself the most cliche riddled backstory you can imagine, and then immediately admits that he made it up.  You can almost feel Haneke reaching through the screen to yell ""Get it?!  You're a fucking moron for wanting a character to have motivated actions!  I'm so much smarter than you!""

In reading various reviews for this movie, it seems like the part that people love to rag on is the remote control scene, in which one of the killers uses a TV remote to reverse time itself and stop his partner from dying.  Honestly, I was so checked out by that point that I kind of just went ""yeah, of course that happened.""  But yeah, I guess that was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back with regards to this movie having any semblance of credibility.  I don't really even know what trope Haneke was trying to comment on there.  I guess he was just brilliantly subverting the trope of things in a story making sense.

And just when I thought I couldn't hate this movie any more, I googled it to read some reviews from when it came out, and discovered something that managed to drag it beneath rock bottom.  Not only was this a pointless remake of a ten year old movie; it was a remake of this dudes *own* fucking movie.  And not only that, but it's remade vurtuslly shot for shot, with camera angles being laid out identically and lines being delivered in the exact same way.  So one day, while Michael Haneke was performing his daily routine of masturbating to his own image in the mirror, he thought to himself ""you know what?  I'm such a genius artist that the greatest gift I could bestow upon these foolish mortals would be to release my own movie... AGAIN!""

I swear, if Michael Haneke ran a restaurant, he'd just take people's orders, hand them an empty plate, and then climb up on the table and yell ""Oh, were you expecting food, you stupid, dumb idiot?  Why?  Why would you expect such a thing, you dumb, brainwashed rube?  See?  I've deconstructed the trope of restaurants serving food?  Aren't I a genius?""

When the credits finally rolled, I was half expecting it to just be white text that read ""Oh, were you expecting the director's name here?  Well fuck you, moron.  Look, another trope I've subverted.  I'm so fucking smart.""  Although looking back, I'm not sure why I expected that.  There is clearly nothing that Michael Haneke lives more than himself, so he would never pass up on an opportunity to put his name on screen.  I'm honestly impressed.  I have never seen a movie that expresses such utter hatred for the people watching it.  Funny Games is a movie that intentionally makes itself stupid so that it can then call *you* stupid for expecting it to not be stupid.  But here's the thing.  Saying ""oh, it was bad on purpose because it was a commentary on things that are bad"" is not an excuse.  You've still made something bad.

**TL;DR:** Oh, were you expecting a tl;dr?  A succinct summary of the main points of this post?  Well fuck you for expecting that, you stupid idiot.  See?  I've done a deconstruction of tl;drs.  Aren't I a genius?  Where's my Oscar?",movies,1608330582,pjtheman,True,0,20,2020-12-18
Why does Andy Muschietti get given so many projects?,"I mean if you go on the guys wikipedia, its just a laundry list of unrealised projects that are supposedly all still in the works, but I just find it interesting that he gets offered so many directing gigs off the back of not that many movies.

He was previously in the running to direct The Mummy reboot (bullet dodged tbh), Bird Box, He-Man and The Snow White and the Huntsman sequel. He was also attached to direct an Electric State adaptation but I guess the Russo Brothers are doing that now.

He is also apparently still attached to adapt Robotech, Stephen King's the Jaunt, as well as live action adaptations of Dracul, Shadow of the Colossus and Attack on Titan.

There's also a Howling remake for Netflix, and he's obviously directing The Flash Movie for DC.

Does he have a particular style? I mean he mostly does horror, so does that make him suited for all these other projects? I mean James Wan made the jump fairly seamlessly, maybe he's good at pitching?

I mean I'm familiar with directors making a splash with a project and from that they get offered lots of properties. I thought Mama was fine (the short its based off of is probably scarier though) and the first It was enjoyable, wasn't a huge fan of the second one tbh.

Under the Silver Lake may be the best movie I've seen all year.,"I began watching this film as more of a curiosity.  
I first heard about it on [Half in the Bag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPqYOImouvk), and despite looking insanely weird, I decided to give it a shot and was immediately hooked.  
The glamor of old Hollywood is an important ascetic choice, as the themes revolve around the pop-culture icon worship that has been a structural part of our social DNA since the invention of the camera.  
The score was one of the things that stood out to me as a brilliant blend of classic film noir and modern pop songs from the 60's to the 90's.  
On the surface, the story is simple: Man meets girl. Girl disappears. Man looks for girl.  
Add ontop of that: secret codes, hidden maps, bizzar symbolism, murder, mystery and a stoned, skunked Andrew Garfield and you have yourself an instant classic.  
As you've probably guessed, I enjoyed this movie (weirdness and all) immensely.

Comparing Knives Out to other murder mysteries,"I have a final essay I have to do for my intro to film class and I’m writing about how a certain film was inspired by other films.

"Who do you think did the right thing in ""do the right thing""?","I understand that this film has some pretty complicated characters, each with their own flaws, and that different people will come to very different conclusions, and you can't necessarily say anyone is ""wrong"", unless it was something mindnumbingly stupid. 

Personally, I'd sympathise the with sal and say that out of the main characters he was the most ""in the right"" during the film. He was provoked, said some racist stuff in anger, and then smashed a boombox because.  It's not pleasant, and definitely could've been handled better, but that doesn't deserve getting a mob raised against you, and your livelihood destroyed, especially considering just how much he was provoked, and his good nature and tolerance throughout the rest of the film 

His son pino is pretty irredeemable morally, he is very racist, and though he never really takes any actions based on it, he consistently degrades and insults the black people in the community, which is unacceptable.

Buggin out and radio raheem, while probably having the right intentions, did end up starting a conflict over something as minute as which pictures sal has on his wall. They were in no position to demand that sal replace the pictures with black people they idolised. Flip the roles and it would seem ridiculous, and Italian walking into a black owned restaurant to tell them to add more Italians to the wall. It's not fair. 
They both help escalate the situation into a violent conflict instead of a heated disagreement, especially radio raheem who seems to do everything in his power to piss people off and start arguments, even though he preaches for love. 

Mookie is quite complicated, though he seems to make more missteps than right ones throughout the film. He slacks off on his job, which while nothing too serious, doesn't reflect well on him. He also has a kid he doesn't look after, yet still makes demands as to how he is brought up. He is also the person to start the riot at the end of the film, even though sal has treated him with extraordinary patience for his behaviour in work. 

So that's my subjective view of the main characters in the film, I'm sure plenty don't agree with my assessment, which I guess Is the point of the film.

The final, and most important question is whether the riot was justified at the end of the film?

Personally, I think some form of rioting, or protesting was justified, but not in the form that it was, and that it was severely misguided and ultimately wrong in the film. The police officers were almost definitely in the wrong, getting radio raheem off sal while he was being strangled is fair enough, but continuing to use excessive force when he was ultimately not causing any further damage was unjustified. 

So being angry at the police, and the way they have been treated? Fair enough.

Taking it out on sal, a long time restaurant owner, who although frequently angry and agitated, and somewhat distanced from the community, has done very little wrong, isn't a justifiable act. He didn't kill raheem. Why should he be punished for It? And then contemplating doing the same to the Korean shop opposite him, the owners of which had absolutely no involvement in the conflict seems very immoral. 

So in conclusion, I do think something needed to be done, but I don't think they did the right thing in burning saul's place down.

Jurassic Park vs. Jaws. Which was the better film?,"Both of these movies were absolutely incredible.

Problem is there's a sense of bias. You have people who watched Jaws as kids and Jurassic Park as adults, so they have more nostalgia bias towards Jaws. Then you have younger people who are in their mid 20's who watched Jurassic Park first when they were kids, and probably Jaws much later as they got older, and they find JP better again, because off nostalgia bias

But...is there anyone here who watched Jaws and Jurassic Park when they were adults who can give a non-bias view on which is the better film?",movies,1608331756,itwasonlyjustadream,True,0,80,2020-12-18

He even had sex with Grace Kelly, who was trying to kill him at the time because he didn't want his cover to be blown

It has fantastic location designs, the werewolves look great and the action is fun to watch.

It also captures the ‘gothic’ theme well.

Plus it has a decent story, and the build up to Van Helsing and Dracula’s final battle has great build up

"In Kill Bill, Hattori Hanzo and Pai Mei are meant to represent polar opposites as a good and a evil teacher respectively.","An aspect from the Kill Bill I don't often see discussed is how each of the two volumes introduces us to a Martial Arts master of Bill, and how each holds completely different views on their apprentice. Both these teachers are directly inspired by very different legendary figures for Martial Arts, with vastly different personalities.

In Volume I we are introduced to the legendary Hattori Hanzo (played by famous martial artist japanese actor Sonny Chiba). The name is itself borrowed from a famous ninja and samurai from the Tokugawa period, famous for his hability and loyalty. Throughout history there have been at least 5 famous Hattori Hanzo's from that family. If the Hanzo from the movie is a descendant, it is not known.

In the movie, Hanzo taught Bill how to be a master swordsman, and, while we never see Bill at his full potential, I think we can judge his skills at least partially from what we see in Beatrix, since she learned from him. Besides being a great (the greatest?) swordsman, Hanzo is a master swordsmith and forges several for his pupil.

By the time we meet Hanzo in Volume I he is retired and deeply shamed by his past. **The fact that his apprentice, Bill, has used his teachings for hired killing torment him considerably.** Enough to make him swear a vows never to make a blade again, and then break it to forge for Beatrix the weapon she will need to kill his former apprentice. Here we see a classic trope of the tortured and disgraced samurai. This is famous in Japanese movies, being utilized by directors such  as Kurosawa, and latter migrating to american movies through the japanese influence in westerners. Look at the conflicted tortured Cowboy, who wants to make ammends for his past.

**Hanzo is honorable and cerimonial, a good teacher and master who expects to see his teachings carried out in a honorable fashion.**

Then we have Pai Mei. Himself a legendary figure in Chinese martial arts, Pai Mei (Bak Mei) is said to have been one of the 5 legendary elders who survived the massacre and destruction of the Shaolin (yes that one) Temple in the 17th century. According to legend, Pai Mei betrayed the monks and aided in its destruction. He was a Taoist monk himself, and master of his own style. Pai Mei is very popular in chinese martial arts movies and is almost always portrayed as the proud and skilled villanous Kung fu master.

In Volume II we are introduced to Pai Mei (played by famous martial artist chinese actor Gordon Liu, who in the past played the enemy of Pai Mei in multiple movies such as Fists of the White Lotus). He is a famous (possibly ancient, we do not know) Kung Fu master who taught Bill his kung fu techniques. He is known for his cruelty and pride, and Bill openly tells Beatrix about how Pai Mei slaughtered the entire Shaolin Temple out of spite. Throughout the movie we see that he is indeed cruel, proud and filled with contempt. He hates Japanese, hates women, is easly offended and retaliates with absolute violence. **He does not care that Bill is a killer, and, in fact, the only reason he trains Beatrix is because Bill asks him to do it.** Pai Mei does not have any regrets and, throughout his chapter in the movie, shows that strength is the only thing he really respects.  I would go so far as to say that he is proud of his former apprentice.

In Kill Bill he fits perfectly with the same antagonists from the chinese Martial Arts movies. The difference is that our protagonist is not his opponent, but his pupil.

**Pai Mei is a cruel and ruthless master that cares only for martial arts, regardless of what people do with these martial skills.**

In conclusion, they are both masters of their own dominion. One a swordsman, the other a Kung Fu warrior. One is good, the other is not. Both are straight up taken from history, and are parts of established cinema tropes, from Japanese and Western movies to Chinese Kung Fu cinema.

TL:DR - Hattori Hanzo and Pai Mei are legendary figures, one a honorable swordsman and the other a cruel Kung Fu master. Both taught Bill, but represent very different sides of combat, as the former regrets Bill's mercenary life, and the latter is indifferent to it, carying only for skill. They are also very established movie tropes of the tortured and disgraced samurai in Japanese movies for Hanzo, and the evil Kung Fu Master for Pai Mei.",movies,1608334106,Mervynhaspeaked,True,335,220,2020-12-18

IMO if someone is going to bring this up there should be a justification other than simply two men being close in the plot.

Black Water Abyss Review,"Just seen this film on Netflix let’s explore this cave.

Let’s start with the things I like which isn’t a lot. Eric is actually a pretty cool character. I like his bit with Cash when they were trying to find the way out. Cash was also probably the smartest character. I swear some of these characters are dumb asf. That’s about all I like.

Now the things I don’t like:
-The Movie feels so long and boring
There are so many scenes that are just filled with nothing but silence and staring at shit. The characters conversations don’t even feel any emotion. They’re trying to convince us that they are long term friends and best friends. Especially Jen, holy hell.

-The characters: Mainly Jen
If you’re making any movie, you need good characters. The characters in this film are so stupid I can’t even. Let’s start of at the start of the film. Why is Jen snooping through Eric’s phone and we’re supposed to like her already. No I’ll think your a bit of a bitch. Our first introduction to our main character is already making me dislike her. Next bit which makes me dislike her is that she is so fucking selfish. I know it’s realistic to be selfish in those situations but come on, when the croc was coming towards her and Victor. She climbs the rock first instead of Victor. Now to be fair, it might’ve been easier to pull him up then to push him up but I don’t know. Also Victors death is stupid. Instead of climbing to safety, he looks at the water like “oh I think it’s gone” why would it be gone? Just climb back up to be safe. When Jen, Eric and Yolanda meet up again, Jen tells them that Victor has died and instead of saying anything nice or comforting Yolanda. She bitches her way into making her feel like shit even more. Jen pretty much says fuck you I don’t care that your husband just died. You two cheated so fuck you. Also if it was an accident, why do you put up photos of each other and put other proof that Jen probably all ready found out about. 

-The Ending
Oh god, Eric doesn’t need to die here. Honestly think if they all swam to the exit they all would’ve made it but what ever. Now the car crash scene is so retarted I can’t. Instead of maybe you know, pushing the brake pedal. You drive into the water you were just in. Surly you knew it was there because you just came from there. 

Next up is the actual ending. Jen instead of helping Yolanda she selfishly goes quicker to escape. Tbf she did start to shoot the croc but wait, WITH ONE HAND AIM, wtf. Surly she’s stupid right, maybe use both arms to have better grip and accuracy. Idk but when Yolanda finally gets up, instead of running, she keeps shooting even though she’s shit. Fuck off. I wish she died at the end. Thanks for Reading, leave your own thoughts about the film.",movies,1608158708,Ventirx,True,1,1,2020-12-16
Very very obscure movie,"This may not be the right sub BUT I've spent, and I cannot stress this next part enough, COUNTLESS HOURS searching for an obscure scene from an obscure movie I saw when I was like 4 in the 90's.

My mom and sister used to watch Lifetime, made for TV movies and I remember watching one with them one time and there's a scene in this one that I'm trying to locate where there's this angry middle aged woman in her kitchen wrapping Christmas presents for a party she's having and one of her friends, Patsy, she's angry with for some reason and, to the person in the kitchen to whom she's venting her frustration with Patsy she says ""and this is Patsy's; PATSY PATSY PATSY"" and with each ""PATSY"" she stabs Patsy's gift with a steak knife before throwing the gift onto the pile of other gifts. 

That is the only 10 seconds of that movie I remember and I don't know why but it plays in my head CONSTANTLY. I have googled any combination of phrases I can think of which would accurately describe the scene I'm thinking of but Google yields no results. 

Have any of you got any ideas as to what I'm thinking of?",movies,1608158893,notyouraveragegayguy,True,3,6,2020-12-16

WW84 is great,"I'm fortunate I got to see it. Here's my take on it.

Story:
Its a simple story and the trailer pretty much shows you what you need to know but everything is turned up a notch. Its got an important message and it has some lessons to be learned. Its more than a simple hero vs villain story. Importantly so, it wasn't predictable. It has a lot of surprises for the fans even in the post credits scene so even if you do predict it then it most likely won't go the way you're thinking. The story is also totally standalone and its the next chapter that progresses after the first one. Its a classic wonder woman story set in 1984.

Acting:
All the actors are great but Pedro Pascal is phenomenal. I first saw him in Narcos and he's come a long way. He shows a lot of range here. Gal Gadot's acting is also great and better than before. The movie worked to her strengths.

Downsides:
If there is any downside then I would say its the CGI. In some closeup shots its noticeable. The story also felt short and lacked depth. By the end I was wondering what would happen to certain characters but they never concluded so you'll never know. It felt inconclusive. I like open endings but for this one they should've shown more since the next movie would probably be in a different era.

Should you watch it?
This movie is worth a watch.
If you hate the first one, you may like this. If you liked the first one then you'll like this more. Even if you're not a wonder woman fan, you would enjoy this (I wasn't and I did).",movies,1608159752,sidTheGamer,True,1,4,2020-12-16
The ending of Green Street Hooligans is infuriating,"God Elijah Wood's character is just the worst. To top it all off he leaves England with his sister's family in a total wreck, Pete dead and Steve's life ruined beyond repair and they all have to pick up the pieces, while Elijah just goes home like no harm done. 

But then the last shot of him walking around Boston with that smug look on his face with this renewed sense of confidence and all is well in his life. 

Fuck that. If he never came over Steve and his family could have lived happily ever after.",movies,1608160133,Nyrfan1026,True,1,13,2020-12-16

Was the: “IN 3D” film era the worst era of film?,"I just remember a time we’re every movie had to be IN 3D. Oh, it’s coming at you, oh, it’s right in your face, oh it’s really in your face. I swear to god it ruined Cinema for me. I came back Around to Cinematic experiences that take place in the theatre though, and I’m glad that we’ve evolved past making every movie IN 3D. Even Harold and Kumar 3 was in 3D for some reason. It felt so gimmicky. If your gonna do a gimmick, at least make it worth it, like IMAX.

"What Movie Made an Impact on You and the Audience in the Theater, and because of that it Stood out to you?","For me there are 3 movies that were such a huge impact on people and myself watching in the theater, that I can clearly remember. The first was Signs, when the Alien appeared in the end in the reflection of the TV screen and everyone in the theater screamed, Everyone. Second, In Insidious, when the Darth Maul Demon appeared and everyone's heart just gave out and all I could hear was a high pitch cry from a loud crowd. Finally the third, In Avengers: Endgame, there were several in the movie, but the most impactful was when Thanos snapped his fingers and I have never heard a theater so silent before, then all of a sudden it turns to sadness. Its amazing to me how much watching a movie with a full audience is different then watching it at home. What has your experience been like?",movies,1608161287,mjhfootball,True,0,22,2020-12-16
The Last Starfighter.... deserves more recognition.,"Me being a giant /r/lv426 fan, I've been revisiting Ron Cobb's amazing life. We lost him in September.. . a few of his movies he worked on:

Back to the Future, Real Genius, Leviathan, Firefly , Titan A.E., Total Recall, The Abyss, Amazing Stories, Aliens, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Alien, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, Conan, Dark Star. HE WAS UNREAL.

So, in revisiting his work, I'm watching Last Starfighter blu ray, and realize it's not only magical, but if they're peeling off gamers from places like earth, there are endless worlds that you could build into the universe, and I'm almost thinking a reboot of this could be more interesting and imaginative than Star Wars, and where it has chosen to boldly not go. Yes that's a Star Trek punk, sorry.

I guess I'm saying give it a watch if you haven't, and like gaming or sci-fi. But also if anyone in the know actually knows about TLS IP and if it has any plans, I would be fascinated to know!

There's only two movies left that actually deserve or need to be remade, and it's LSF ""next generation"", and Trading Places w/ Dan and Eddie being Mortimer and Randolph.",movies,1608161917,unclefishbits,True,13,148,2020-12-16

Your Favorite Blu-Ray Collections/Box-Sets?,"I've been collecting Blu-Ray collections/box-sets that I find cool for about a year now, and I feel like I've kind of hit an end point of where I'm not sure what else to get.

I've tried to google to find a comprehensive list of box-sets specifically but I haven't really found any. So, I figured I could list the ones that I own, and maybe anyone who wants to could add their suggestions and I can edit the main post to have everything in one place. Also, I know about The Criterion Collection of box-sets, they're cool for sure, just a bit pricy, but they can definitely be listed as well.

Not Another (Teen Movie) Top 10 Movie List,"This isn't a best movie list, just my 10 favorite movies. I'd say that 5 or 6 of these are pretty set in stone, and the other 4-5 I could interchange depending on how I'm feeling. I do really enjoy every single one of these though. I'd love to hear your thoughts, or your own list.

&amp;#x200B;

1.Dragonheart - I really just love this movie, and I can't recommend it enough. The CGI holds up. The soundtrack shines and is one of my favorite ever, especially To The Stars.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Star Trek (2009) - \*Disclaimer\* I had not watched any other Trek films and maybe a handful of episodes before this. I'm no movie critic, but I think this movie is just great on all levels. They nailed the casting, story, and atmosphere here. It's a movie I could watch again and again.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Transformers (2007) - Not a lot of movies have given me chills the way that this one did the first time I saw Optimus transform, and I'll never forget it. I loved transformers growing up. Watched the cartoons, and to see them put to life on the big screen like this was surreal for me. I also happen to enjoy the score quite a bit. The Bumblebee scene will make me cry, every time.

&amp;#x200B;

4. Howl's Moving Castle/ Spirited Away - I flip flop back and forth on which one of these is my favorite Miyazaki movie. In fact, I really enjoy all of his movies, the soundtracks, art, and stories are always great. You're doing yourself a disservice if you've never seen any of them.

&amp;#x200B;

5. Beverly Hills Ninja - This has to be my favorite Farley movie. It has it all, action, romance, comedy, and it's just so cheesy that it's great. The Tarzan Boy scene when he's swinging on the palm tree makes me laugh every time. 

&amp;#x200B;

6. How to Train Your Dragon - I love dragons, and I love this movie. The world, the art, the story, the music, are all top notch for me. It's a cliche movie, but if you're gonna be cliche, might as well knock it out of the park.

&amp;#x200B;

7. The Last Samurai - I have no idea either how historically accurate this movie is, but I really enjoy the setting. The story always draws me in, and I always get so mad at the ending. Good acting too, just a good movie for me.

&amp;#x200B;

8. Interstellar - I saw this movie in Dolby with an empty theater except for my buddy and I, and it was mind-blowing. I have a very active imagination, and this movie just did it for me. Never once did I think about it, or question how things could happen, I just enjoyed it. One of the movies that makes me feel like a kid staring in wonder up at the stars.

&amp;#x200B;

9. About Time - My favorite RomCom ever. The acting is superb, it's so much more than just a Romance movie. The setting is great, and the relationship with his sister and dad is perfect. This movie always makes me tear up, if you've seen it, you know when.

&amp;#x200B;

10. The Punisher - Thomas Jane is the Punisher, he gets revenge, and he does it in style. Not the greatest movie, but it is a guilty pleasure of mine.",movies,1608163503,Hunted-Wumpus,True,1,43,2020-12-16

What are some recent-ish movies I could consider getting for my conservative parents that isn't already on N3tflix or Prim3 (and isn't rated R)?,"(had to alter the title otherwise I get falsely auto-flagged by the streaming services bot, and the mods haven't responded to my message from 5hrs ago)

Every Christmas I like to get my parents a movie or season of a tv show that they probably haven't seen and that I think is actually good. Been having a bit of trouble this year as almost everything I watch they would turn off or just not be interested in.

For some reference into things I've already bought them: A lot of Pixar movies, the LEGO Movie, Juno, The Help, Leave No Trace, We Bought A Zoo, The Middle (1st season), Bob's Burgers (1st season). They've been pretty ""meh"" about everything except the Pixar movies and We Bought A Zoo.

This year my short list has become War With Grandpa, Godmothered, or possibly The Martian. As I said, they're conservative, so too much swearing? They turn it off. Gay characters kissing? They turn it off. A long or too revealing sex scene? They turn it off. You get the idea. This is why even PG-13 is a toss up. And they have N3tflix and Prim3, so I don't want to get anything that's already on those services.

I did a little experiment. Introducing: Alternate BBC Top 100 Films of the 21st Century,"[Here's the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14_QlnLXfiIsRC5bCvmkH0mrKQBsv3UTNCKDx4LJ3Sq4/edit?usp=sharing) if you're interested, but if you would let me explain myself first.

I'm a film fan, which inevitably means I'm a fan of movie lists, top 10's, top 100, etc. One of the more interesting lists to come out recently was the BBC Top 100 Movies of the 21st Century. It's an interesting list, meant to highlight modern day classics, but what was most fascinating was how they tallied the votes. 177 critics the world over where asked to rank their 10 favorite films from the 21st century, with their first place pick receiving 10 points, second place receiving 9 points, and so on until their tenth place film, which would receive 1 point. It more or less made sense, but it did make me think about another famous all time great films list, Sight and Sound's Centennial Poll. In that one, people are also asked to name 10 films, but their votes only count as 1 point. So it got me thinking, what if the BBC list was voted on the same way? Instead of ranking them, what if people simply picked 10 movies? How would this turn out? Of course, it's not an apple's to oranges comparison. The Sight and Sound list is a formal poll held every 10 years, split into critics and directors, and all films ever made are eligible. BBC's was just a one and done thing, with only a relatively few number of critics compared to Sight and Sound, and obviously  choices were limited to 21st century films. Still, I wanted to see what this alternate list would look like, and since BBC handily showed every critic's list, I got straight to work with my handy buddy, Google Sheets.  The result was, well the list above.

Again, this was just an interesting little experiment. I have no issues with how BBC conducted their list, and I'm not out to make a point. I just had a lot of time on my hand and I knew that if I thought about it anymore, I would never make it, so I just got straight to work. 

If you're still reading you're obviously interested, so here's some interesting facts.

* Separated by one measly vote, in the alternate list ""In the Mood for Love"" dethrones ""Mulholland Drive"" to be the new number 1 film. Evidently, on the official list while Love was included more, Mulholland placed higher to reach the top.
* In truth, the entire top 10 on both lists have the same films, with the 3rd through 6th spots having the same placements on both lists, but from then on the spots are shifted around. The farther down you go on the alternate list, the more it diverges from the official one.
* Ties are ranked alphabetically, but you'll see that there's plenty of them on the lower half of the alt list. I believe this has to do with how varied the lists were (there were 587 different films listed, with 339 receiving only 1 vote) and with the fact that while 177 is a lot of people, it's relatively small compared to the likes of Sight and Sound's most recent 2012 poll, with a whopping 846 critics voting, and another 358 directors voting on their own list.
* I don't have time to check every single film that got knocked out in the alternate list and which new ones made it in, but SOME notable additions on the alternate list were Birdman, Selma, Femme Fatale, Kill Bill Vol 1 (one other person voted for Vol 2, so theoretically if counted as one film, kill bill would land even higher), and.... Borat. All were frequent picks, but due to their lower placement on the list, they missed landing on the official top 100.
* I think I'm missing one or two films that I neglected to add on the alternate list, but they received only one vote, I was nearing the end, my fingers were dying, and I wanted to be over with it, so yeah. If you'd like, the BBC showed [all the critics and how they voted, so there you go.](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films-who-voted)

Better movie: An American in Paris (1951) or Singin’ in the Rain (1952)?,"Both movies are musicals and star Gene Kelly. Both of these movies are very good so this may be a tough call. In this case of American in Paris, it has great George Gershwin music and amazing music sequences. I especially liked the scene where Adam Cook is imagining himself running an entire orchestra. The last 15 minutes are also amazing. The music, the choreography, the sets, the costumes, etc. it’s all a feast for the senses.

Still, Singin’ in the Rain beats it for me. I find the songs in it to be more memorable and iconic. Sure you have the iconic dancing in the rain sequence but there’s also Good Morning and Make Em Laugh which continues to add to the fun. Not to mention there are some funny scenes regarding the transition of silent movies to “talkies” and the cast and crew trying to adapt. It’s all great stuff.

"HBO Max is letting moviegoers decide for the first time how they want to watch newly released movies. If consumers decide they want to watch it at home more so than the theaters, doesn't that shine a light on the problem with the movie-going experience?","Personally, my favorite way of seeing a film is the movie theater, but because of covid, like many, I will probably watch these new WB movies at home. After covid, I will not, I seriously love movie theaters.

I think those that are saying HBO Max is destroying movies are overreacting. I believe most people who love cinema will continue to go to the theater once things get back to normal. 

However, I've never heard these big time hollywood directors berate the theaters for having $8 hotdogs, unclean theaters, uncomfortable chairs, expensive movie tickets, terrible customer service, boring arcade games if they have any at all, etc etc

Granted, new modern day movie theaters are opening up and having reclined chairs in regular theatres are becoming the norm. 

But it's nowhere where it could be, and maybe instead of being angry that people can watch new movies at home in a time of struggle, they could challenge movie theaters to find ways to be more enticing.",movies,1608167602,knowsallaboutnothing,True,3,296,2020-12-16

"Character analysis for Lancaster Dodd, and Freddie quell in ""The Master""?","I absolutely love this film, the cinematography, the acting, the setting.  It's all pretty brilliant.

These two characters really intrigue me, but everytime I think I've got them pegged, something else throws me off, and I feel like maybe it was all just shadows on the wall, and I've missed the true meaning.

I think I've got a better Idea about Freddie, so I'll start with him. 


Personality and character traits:

He's clearly traumatised from his time in the war, (though he had problems beforehand), and finds some level of belonging and meaning in ""the cause"". His lack of meaning and purpose may be why he decided to join the army in the first place, as well as his fears of getting into a relationship. He is constantly entrapped in the film, which makes him extremely volatile and agitated. Anytime he feels trapped, he tries to flee and ignore the issue, as with his girlfriend, with the moonshine poisoning, with his girlfriend in the department store, and on many other occasions. He is animalistic, and obsessed with sex. something which is regularly referred to by Dodd and the rest of the cast. He also makes lewd jokes and threats to deflect away from what is bugging him emotionally

Development: 

He finds some meaning in his life with ""the cause"". Dodd claims to have all the answers, and quell laps it up because it makes him feel happy.  He develops a good relationship with Dodd, and becomes a sort of sidekick to his schemes. He puts his full trust in Dodd, and Dodd somewhat reciprocated. His violent nature prompts the rest of the scientologists to try and change him. This process works and helps him to reconcile with his nature to an extent. He becomes more aware of his previous failures and decides to tackle them head on, returning as promised, to the girl he ran away from years earlier. However, unsurprisingly, she has moved on and his return is too late to make a difference. This destroys most of the progress he has made, and sends him flying back to Dodd and the scientologists.  When he gets a cold reception from them, it breaks what is left, and regresses him back to what he was before, a desperately lost person looking for, but unable to obtain lasting love. 

Now, onto Dodd.

Personality and character traits: 

Emasculated, emotionally fragile, and constantly lonely. Dodd is an intimidating figure outwardly, and holds great away over his congregation with his impressive manipulation skills. However, internally he is just as lost and lonely as Quell is, something that he may find some solidarity in. We find out that his son dislikes him, his wife is manipulating him and is really the power behind him. His congregation, while obsessive and devoted, are only there to seek answers from him, and never truly care for him. When interacting with them, he has a happy veneer, but it is clear that the constant prostylatising wears him out and makes him upset. Quell, while volatile, and disobedient, shows genuine love for Dodd, and not the veneer that everyone else has. Dodd may chastise him for his nature, but is more often than not laughing with him by the end of a conversation. 
He sticks up for Quell, and shows real affection for him.

Development: 

He starts off simply manipulating Quell as he would with any other person, but eventually manifests into a weird, fucked up, but somewhat tender and affectionate relationship. Quell is his escape from the loneliness and the conditional live of his congregation and family. They eventually end up with a symbiotic relationship in which Dodd provides happiness for Dodd through his psychoanalysis, and Quell provides happiness for Dodd through his realness, and true affection for Dodd. However, by the end of the film this all comes crashing down. Quell leaves, and abandons Dodd. Dodd's wife also becomes more prevalent, and it seems implied that she may have some influence in the cold response to  Quell on his return. Whatever the reasons are, the breakup of their relationship destroys Dodd in the same way it destroys Quell. He ends up lonely once more, in his crowd of mindless supporters.

There are also some homosexual undertones between Dodd and Quell that I wouldn't discount, but their ""love"" for each other makes sense as both platonic and romantic, so it doesn't really influence my interpretation much.

Sorry for the rambling, but these characters are very complex, and I'm kind of overwhelmed trying to for it all together.

What are your interpretations of the characters, and of the film itself? I'm very interested to hear what you thought of it!",movies,1607988003,a_reasonable_thought,True,1,3,2020-12-14

I'm looking for recommendations for movies that give some insight to the lives of the people in your country and at the same time is one of the best made in that particular language. 

Please also do tell why you think the movie represents your country the best and if possible where they can be streamed from.

"In The Silver Linings Playbook, is Pat beating up the history teacher a delusion?","I’m obsessed with this movie (I ordered the book, should be arriving soon). In the scene where we first meet Dr. Patel, Pat arrives at the Dr’s office and hears the song that triggers him. However, he asks the receptionist if the song is really playing or not and if the other doctor, from the hospital put them up to it. Additionally, when he goes in to talk with Dr. Patel, Pat comments that it was bad taste for him to be playing that song and how rude it was since it’s the first time they are meeting and then Dr. Patel just apologizes, why would a psychiatrist trigger a patient on purpose like this? This could be dangerous, it doesn’t make sense. But then, when Pat tells the story about how he beat up the history teacher, Dr. Patel asks about a previous episode in which Pat explains he had a delusion that his wife and the history teacher were plotting to embezzle money for the school. To me that sounds like it’s not really clear if he also had a delusion about his wife cheating on him with the guy and beating him up.",movies,1607993319,Bruxa1111,True,1,2,2020-12-14
James Cameron is arguably responsible for both the most stereotypically beloved men's movie and also women's,"If you think about this way.

I think it's fair to say that there is a stereotype, which I would say is based in some truth, that many boys/men loved Terminator 2. It's always been regarded as one of Arnold's best, and its definitely could be said to be one of the ""manliest"" films, up there with Predator.

However, there's also this stereotype, which again has some truth, that Titanic is beloved by girls/women. Growing up, I knew a lot of girls at school and older women who loved this film. Needless to say, most people who I've met that really love this film are women.

Now these are broad generalizations, but I do feel there is some element of truth with boys loving T2 and girls loving Titanic.

And yet, both directed by James Cameron. I just find that kind of cool.",movies,1607993391,ThrowawayTiredow,True,1,98,2020-12-14

Anyone else straight up done monetarily supporting remakes?,"I did a quick text search to see if this was a topic of discussion recently and didn't see one. I'm sure it's brought up a lot, but I wanted to see if anyone else had an opinion.

Seems to me that as the years go by, fewer and fewer unique titles come out and more and more ""remakes"", ""reboots"", and ""re-imaginings"" are getting released. That's feeling is completely anecdotal and might not be supported by hard evidence. In the middle of writing this post, I've googled and found several articles pointing this same feeling out, as well as some supporting it with actual evidence.

Is anyone else just kinda done with ""remakes"", regardless of how good they are? I know many of them have been great, but it's started to really grate on me recently. The trend towards producing remakes, adaptations, seqeuels, prequels, etc. seems like a decision based on analytics; As though people have found that these things produce a much more predictable revenue stream and so studios have been hedging their bets with them. Overall this trend has increasingly sent me away from Film/TV as a medium and towards novels in my spare time.

I'll still happily watch remakes after-the-fact once they've hit streaming services, but I think I'm ready for a personal boycott of all remakes and tangential sequels for the foreseeable future. Anyone else hitting that same point?

Also: Feel free to link me to a larger discussion about this topic, I'm also going to keep searching for one so I can read the same kinds of opinions that I'd expect to see as replies here.",movies,1607994812,jestlolk,True,1,15,2020-12-14

"Gravity dir by Alfonso Cuaron: Lauded at the time, rarely discussed today.","Remember Gravity? When that movie came out, it was all you heard about for the next few months. ""You've got to see Gravity! You've got to see Gravity! See it in IMAX 3D, it's an E X P E R I E N C E."" It was the 8th highest grossing film of it's year, universally lauded like few films are, and ran away with the most oscar wins of the year, including best director, losing best picture to the other runaway hit of the year, 12 Years A Slave. 

However, nowadays Gravity isn't as talked about as much. Despite people calling the film a cinematic achievement and one of the new all time greats, it's sort of faded away into obscurity. More attention has since gone to Cuaron's previous directorial effort, Children of Men. Having just this year seen both films, I agree that Children of Men is the superior of the two, however my hypothesis is that people tend to gravitate more to Children of Men because it was a box office bomb with not much attention at the time, while Gravity got shoved down everyone's throat for a few months. Also, while both movies have aged remarkably well, Children of Men has been labelled prescient for it's outlook on geo-politics, polarization, nationalism, immigration and refugee crisis, and the pandemic. Still, I find it fascinating just how acclaimed Gravity was at the time, but how little it's discussed today. So, what do you think? Was Gravity just the zeitgeist of it's time, or is it a decent flick that was overhyped?",movies,1607995502,Grand_Keizer,True,1,17,2020-12-14

“AVA” - Review,"Ok, so I’m gonna start off by saying that I love Jessica Chastain. I think she’s a great actress and that most movies I’ve seen her in are pretty decent (see Interstellar and Zero Dark Thirty). That being said, her new film “AVA,” which came out this last August, is by far the worst Jessica Chastain film I have seen.

Chastain stars as the titular character Ava Faulkner, a professional assassin with a troubled past working for a mysterious company. Growing up she was an honor student, valedictorian, and participated in fencing, rock climbing, archery, etc., until a car accident caused her to fall into alcoholism and drug use. While at her lowest she enlists in the army and makes herself known as an expert sniper and combatant. She then is honorably discharged and becomes an assassin.

Now where have we heard all of this before? Try ALMOST EVERY ASSASSIN/HITMAN MOVIE EVER MADE. And that’s not the only cliché. Ava also has strained relationships with her mother and sister, who both neither know what she does for a living or where she has been, seeing as she disappeared for the last few years. The passive aggression flows like wine between the three, with half-assed barbs thrown about constantly. 

Ava is also in trouble with the leader of the company she works for, a man known only as Simon (played by Colin Farrell), for trying to ascertain why her targets have been marked for death. Her handler, Duke (John Malkovich) warns her about this, with such robotic acting you’d never think he was at once in danger of giving a fuck (which is how I felt the entire film).

Within the first 30 minutes of the film, I neither cared nor wanted to care about any of the characters, especially Ava. The characters lacked any real depth, which is not the fault of the actors, but with the writing. “AVA” tries desperately to be the female “John Wick,” but ultimately ends up falling flat on its face. 

Despite being a movie about an assassin, we only see two assassinations, and even those are short. The only thing I found myself even remotely enjoyed were the fight scenes. Other than that, I would recommend skipping this one. Unless you’re ok with never getting back the hour and a half you’ll waste watching it. How it got to be #1 on Netflix is a mystery to me.",movies,1607998338,TheRealBubbaJubz,True,1,41,2020-12-14

The Hills Have Eyes 2 (2007) is a guilty pleasure,"I knew going in there was no way you  could beat the 2006 remake but I decided to give the sequel remake a run and I was somewhat surprised at how much I liked it.

It is by no means a masterpiece and  had a plethora of stupid moments by characters but could have been a  snooze fest, but there were so many ""fun"" and engaging elements to it  that kept me wanting to watch it till the end. I enjoyed the premise of a  bunch of ragtag ""soldiers"" falling victim to them one by one as well as  the SFX throughout and I have to say the opening of the film with the  unfortunate pregnant lady is what had me hooked, one of the most brutal  scenes ever, not just for what it shown directly when at the end of  labor, but you know she had been held there restrained to that bed  forced to reproduce for the mutant/s for god knows how long, and just  killed after her usefulness had expired, pretty much tried to set the  tone, but didn't live up to that scene.

If your a comedy fan don't miss this movie called...PCU (politically correct university)...dont miss this one!,"To start this movie has such a great cast. Jeremy Piven, Jon Favreau, David Spade and Chris Young to name a few. It focuses on a young student (Chris Young) visiting a college campus (Port Chester) to decide if he wants to attend. He immediately meets the leader (Jeremy Piven) of a group of students who run the ""pit"". Sort of the slackers of the campus, but they also know how to have fun and not take themselves too seriously. Pivens character shows Young all the ins and outs of who and what are the ""cool"" groups, students, organizations etc...and who to avoid and stay away from at all costs. Young gets a crash course on campus life and an education on just being yourself and not getting stressed with student life. There are a ton of laughs throughout and Jon Favreaus character as ""gutter"" is hilarious! If you can watch this film. You definatelywon't be disappointed.",movies,1607814119,leppard111,True,1,15,2020-12-12

From toy story to finding Nemo: the fall of Pixar,"Toy story was an extremely mature kids story filled with angles such as replacement, lewedness , drinking, depression, and ultimately friendship and collaboration. It’s a great movie and something all children benefited from . Finding Nemo was not that. It was a typical back of the napkin story of going to some far away place in a zig zag fashion with the friends you meet along the way. Sure there's some stuff about parent child relationship but the ending where Nemo told everyone to swim down was forced and the entire thing skimped on anything approaching an interesting plot. But it made a ton of money and Pixar would rather do that than make a real movie. Monsters Inc was the Midway point between these two ideas I think",movies,1607814978,kawhisasshole,True,1,18,2020-12-12

I've only seen Clerks a few months ago and it has truly changed my life,"Though I didn't know anything about the story, I was quite expecting to watch it, because I knew Kevin Smith and that it was a cult classic. I was expecting some buddy-nerd comedy but it was the opposite, and I loved it.

Through my first watch, I thought it was interesting. I appreciated the ""auteur"" approach of it being in black &amp; noir with the title cards. But still, it seemed to be boring and empty. However, Silent Bob's line and Randall's end speeches really surprised me and deeply touched me. Then I kept thinking about the movie, and I realized how deep and relatable it was. I began to see the peculiar direction, with static shots and long takes. I see now the movie's beauty, charm and genius. It is, in my opinion, a unique and harsh movie. Also, the running jokes, like the cigarette or ""37 cocks"" are hilarious.

To explain more, I've been a depressed teenager for years, knowing what my defaults are but not working on them. Randall's speech directly talked to me and I related to so many aspects of Dante's situation, specially the recurring ""I'm not supposed to be here"". Dante's frustration with his life is so well-written, and the contrast with his best friend is brilliant. Randall is a loser, just like his friend, but he assumes it and lives with it, unlike Dante who constantly suffers in silence. It taught me that I don't have to be a perfect person, not doing any mistakes and that I don't have to blame others for my misery. Randall is right, he knows what he wants and shows Dante how blind he is. I'm not saying that Randall is a role model, what I'm trying to explain is that you can complain all you want about your life situation and relationships, but at some point you need to take responsibility. You either embrace that you're a simple clerk, or you try to improve your life. So even though my situation won't change tomorrow, the importance is how I adapt to it. If I'm not supposed to be in a place one day, I can work so it's not the case, instead of hating the world around me.

Clerks is one of the most fascinating movies I've ever seen. It spoke to me on a personal level like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but here it was way more honest and direct and yet subtle. I'm so glad it was so different from what I was expecting, it helped me a lot in the therapy and changes I'm going through. Thanks for reading, and tell me if you share some thoughts about this movie.",movies,1607818572,ockedman,True,1,36,2020-12-12

5 film roles Michael Keaton turned down,"Which do you think he would have been best in?: 

The Fly
Michael Keaton was offered the leading role of Dr. Seth Brundle in the 1986 sci-fi horror, but turned it down to work on Gung Ho and Touch and Go instead. 

Batman Forever
When Tim Burton dropped out of Batman Forever, Keaton followed too. Desperate to keep their star Warner Bros. offered him $15million, which was a huge payday for 1995. Keaton met with Joel Schumacher but was unhappy with the screenplay, he felt it was too lighthearted. So no matter how big the check was, Keaton wasn't playing.

Philadelphia 
Jonathan Demme initially wanted Daniel Day-Lewis to play Andrew Beckett. He turned it down in favor of In the Name of the Father (1993). Michael Keaton was the second choice to play Andrew Beckett. He turned down the role and made My Life (1993) instead.

Kingpin
Kingpin is another movie that Michael Keaton had actually signed on to star in (in what ended up being Woody Harrelson's part - Roy Munson). Keaton left the project after a script rewrite, he liked the original version which was “character-driven rather than joke-driven.” Eventually the production company, Rysher Entertainment, had a change of heart and got back in contact with Keaton, offering to film with the original script if he'd come back to the project. But Keaton was already committed to Multiplicity, and passed.

Get Shorty 
Michael Keaton was not the first choice to play Chilli Palmer in the 1995 movie, that was John Travolta, but he turned it down (stay with me). So Keaton was offered the role, he said no, so did Robert De Niro and Bruce Willis. Quentin Tarantino then told Travolta that he should've taken the part, so he changed his mind.",movies,1607822643,SuddenGlass,True,1,49,2020-12-12

Having trouble remembering rare horror films I discovered at Blockbuster in the mid/early 2000s,"So around the mid to early 2000s, one summer my sister and I discovered at our local Blockbuster a series of horror films that were presented as a DVD set. I think the (movie publishing company of some sort??) would come out with a new selection every year. They were all films (possibly indie films) that were too scary to be put in theaters. I remember there being ten different films, and my sister and I rented a few, but one in particular scared the living hell out of us. 

It was about a group of teenagers/college kids going down to Mexico for spring break. The film had a really nice sepia tone aesthetic, which really added to the creepiness, and this was long before that film aesthetic got into style. But anyway, they all go down to Mexico, and one of the guys gets drugged and kidnapped by two men. They just took him off the street in broad daylight and put him in a pickup truck. They bring him to a run down house/shed and start torturing him. It was so realistic, in a sense that there wasn’t really dramatic music and lighting to make it kitch-y and spooky like other horror films. It was like we were watching it actually happening. My sister asked if I wanted to turn it off and I fully agreed, it was so disturbing. I think we made it 20 min into the film at that point. 

Years and years since, I cannot for the life of me remember what these series of films were called, and I can’t find any evidence of it online. If anyone happens to know what I’m talking about, you’d be helping me so so much.",movies,1607823056,not_suze,True,1,12,2020-12-12

Currently, there are several films that arguably fit these categories that haven’t made the cut such as A Clockwork Orange, The Blair Witch Project, Aliens and Terminator 2: Judgement Day.

Why was Ridley Scott's 'A Good Year' such a box-office bomb?,"Calm down, redditors - I'm not here to try and argue that the movie is some kind of ""misunderstood gem"". Far from it. Personally, I think it's just an amiable time-killer that is not always as funny as it clearly hopes to be.

That being said, however, there are so many worse (and worse-reviewed) rom-coms that routinely gross significantly more at the box-office that I can't help but wonder how a harmless, warm-hearted effort from Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe could've have sold just $7.4 million worth of tickets in the USA. I mean, a modestly successful movie of the same genre without the same pedigree might have achieved that just during its Friday opening.

By 2006 Crowe already wasn't as big of a draw as he had been earlier in the decade, but still... Just 7 million *total*?

The trope is that the giant monster has cornered a character, and the character just looks right at the monster and screams at it. Then some bullshit happens that repels or kills the monster and the character is saved.

It happens in Godzilla King of the Monsters to Millie Bobbie Brown. She screams at Ghidorah as he's about to blast her with lightning, but Godzilla's atomic breath saves her.

John Doe (Se7en) is a perfect example of how to present and write an antagonist of his nature,"I recently watched Se7en and I think it's now my favourite film of all time. The suspense, drama and writing were all excellent, along with the framing, colour and cinematography. Overall, 10/10 imo.

A stand out in this film is by far, John Doe, the serial killer, whom Detective Somerset and Mills have been chasing after for the whole movie.

He is mysterious, intriguing, intelligent and amazingly acted by Kevin Spacey (which makes sense considering Kevin Spacey is also an insane psychopath), and the few scenes with him in it are a masterclass at showcasing this aspects. 

https://youtu.be/hImAmM5-Fpg

This is his first scene, if you don't count the chase scene 20-30 minutes beforehand. 

First off, it shows how completely and utterly disconnected he is from everything. Blood covered all over him, walking in like it's a normal day when he very well knows the extent of what he's about to do. Nevermind that it's implied this is right after he killed and decapitated David Mills' wife, Tracey, so now it's even worse; now he appears to be uncaring about the vicious and horrible atrocities he's committed. It gives him almost a terrifying presence; his calm and calculated demeanor juxtaposed with the extreme and violent nature of his crimes. They come off as crimes of passion or of extreme hatred but he has the same presence as a nun; quiet and rather disconnected. 

Like I said, this demeanor makes his acts all the more horrific and terrifying:
 
- Forcing a man to kill a woman by telling him to have intercourse with the woman via a predator blade strap on. (Lust)

- Holding a man down with straps for an entire year, barely keeping him alive by feeding him regularly and giving him medicine. By the end, the man's spine is dust and his brain mush. (Sloth)

- Forcing an obese man to shovel food upon food until he passes out and his insides rupture. (Gluttony)

Among others. This comes off as the crimes of am angry and reckless man but in reality, it's a terrifyingly calm and quiet man. 

This is the perfect introduction as it completely defies expectations of what he's going to be like, and somehow makes him even more terrifying than originally thought out to be. 

At this point, it's clear that he has a plan because after all, he did turn himself in. He reveals that he will only plead guilty IF Somerset and Mills agree to find the two remaining bodies of the people he killed. 

Somerset and Mills agree.

https://youtu.be/MUIpgiPBk5k (the description in this video is actually really good, you should read it)

This drive is amazing, as it goes upon this calm demeanor even further and brings out a semblance of anger within John Doe.

First off, this scene builds the climax up excellently. ""I really can't wait for you to see, I really can't, it's really going to be something."" 

Something about that simple line is... Chilling, coming from a serial killer who's killed people in the most depraved of ways. It builds up a sense of fear as to what possibly could be so special about this? How could he top the other murders here? 

His dialogue is also an incredibly example of foreshadowing; in response to Somerset asking why he takes so much pleasure in the fact that he tortures people in the name of God and how it contradicts his martyrdom, John responds ""I doubt I enjoy it more than Mills would enjoy time alone with me in a room with no windows."" By this, he means that Mills wants to hurt him and when he brings up this fact more and more Mills gets frustrated and tells him to ""shut the fuck up"". 

He uses his claim that Mills would enjou to hurting him for what he did to explain why he does enjoy it; ""I won't deny my personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner."" 

Then, the next set of dialogue is incredibly, and I mean, INCREDIBLY, telling.

Mills - ""Wait, all I thought you did was kill innocent people?""

John Doe - ""Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny? An obese man. A disgusting man who could barely stand up, a man, who if you saw on the street, you would point him out to your friends so they could join you in mocking him, a man who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish your meal. And after him, I picked the lawyer and you must have been secretly thanking me for that one. This is a man who dedicated his life to making money by LYING, with every breath that he could muster by keeping murderers and rapists on the streets.""

Mills - ""Murderers.""
.
John Doe - ""A woman-""

Mills - ""Murderers like yourself, John.""

John Doe - ""A WOMAN! So ugly on the inside that she couldn't bear living if she didn't look beautiful on the outside. A-a drug dealer- a drug dealing PEDERAST, ACTUALLY! And let's not forget the disease spreading whore. Only in a world this shitty, could you even try to say these are innocent people with a straight face. 

But that's the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I'm setting the example.""

John Doe genuinely believes he's setting a good example for people to come after him. To make the world better. 

I can't describe what's so special about this scene in particular; the acting, the dialogue, the writing. It's all brilliant but... I can't quite pin down what makes this scene and dialogue exchange so special. I think what it is  was an understanding of him to a certain extent, almost relatable; an anger at the way the world is going. However, what stops people like us and Somerset, who'd normally agree with Doe, from becoming like him is the understanding of why these people became like this or simply realising killing never works out well in the long run.

It tells us everything about John Doe. That's he has, what is essentially, a Messiah complex, a feeling that he is doing what is right. That sinners are evil and must be cleansed. Another foreshadow to the end. 

Now... The final scene.... 

https://youtu.be/1giVzxyoclE

John Doe leads Somerset and Mills to the location. No bodies. When suddenly, a van comes driving by. Somerset gets to it, leaving Mills and Doe to their own devices. 

Somerset gets to the truck to learn there is a package inside of it. He opens it... And is horrified. We don't know what's in it but there's that growing sense of fear that it's something.... Really, really bad.

The camera pans to Mills, and then John says, ""are you listening to me? I'm saying how much I admire you, and your pretty wife.""

We all knew at this point what just occurred. 

This seems hypocritical on John Doe's part... But, he acknowledges that. Knowing he caused a sin (Envy), he sets this all up after the murder to get Mills to kill him for the misdeed that he had caused. Rid the world of sinners, even if it includes him. 

Mills, angry and homicidal, kills John Doe. John Doe won. He successfully enacted every bit of his plan and Mills fell right into it.

This character is brilliant, and definitely my all time favourite antagonist.

One criticism I'd like to address; people say that his plan doesn't make sense because it seems unlikely that he thought he would find someone to be envious of the whole time.

However, when he calls Mills and Somerset, he even says he ""rescheduled his plans"" after meeting Mills, clearly saying he changed his plans after meeting Mills. So that criticism is null now.

What is an underappreciated action movie in your opinion?,"To me it is simple. I think a very underappreciated action movie is The Accountant. It was talked about when it first came out but has since dropped off like it never happened. I am still hoping for some sort of sequel. I think Ben Affleck did a great job in his character. And in the end facing off against Jon Bernthal was just awesome. Don’t get me wrong, the movie has its flaws but it is a movie that has a great rewatch value. After seeing the trailer for “Nobody” and hearing him being called “The Auditor” I immediately thought it would be cool if they existed in the same universe somehow and they somehow had them face off in the future.

Overthinking The Grinch (2018) and Childhood Trauma,"Overall, I’m sure the movie accomplished what it set out to do and a lot of kids/others love it, just not for me. Story was *really* thin, absolute bare bones to string together slapstick comedy scenes. But to way overthink a goofy kids movie, what is there seems a bit fucked up. 

Basically the point of the movie as I see it was “choose to be happy/not lonely”. There’s the standard Grinch message too, but that’s what this version focuses on, while the Jim Carrey version focused on materialism. And unlike the Jim Carrey version, these Who’s are supposed to be good people. Maybe less angelic than the original, but they’re good people with happy lives who never doubt/lack the true meaning of Christmas.

So the Grinch hates Christmas because it represents his broken childhood in an orphanage. He was deprived Christmas in a Who society that idolizes it to a crazy degree, and overall felt neglected by The Who’s. **Who society failed the Grinch**. They have an orphan they basically drive out of town by neglect. Whether this is perceived or real, you can’t blame a child for this, and it had a ripple effect on his life. If there’s more to the story, we’re not shown.

The Who’s are good, they teach him how to be a good happy person in the end... but they failed to do this with him as an orphan child. No lesson is learned on that end, it’s just on the lonely person who probably has some real deep seeded issues to choose to get over it. He sees Cindy Lou/the other Who’s are happy with their family and friends, so duh why not just do that too? What a simple solution. 

Really, why even put the orphanage thing in? It doesn’t go anywhere, it doesn’t mean anything, *he doesn’t talk to anybody about it*, it’s just like a minute of the movie to attempt to give you sympathy for the Grinch... but he’s not even that unlikable in this version. He doesn’t abuse Max, he interacts with the town, he’s just a recluse and a bit of a dick around Christmas. He can just be that and still have to learn to be happy, without the kind of fucked up (dare I say victim blaming) orphanage angle.",movies,1607644011,Door-Aggressive,True,1,3,2020-12-10

It just felt wholly unoriginal and lazy even if it wasn't boring.  It really feels like their milking the pandemic but even more so telling the most obvious story about it even though its fiction.  

Im actually shocked a bit they pulled the cast they did (Demi Moore, Bradley Whitford, Peter Stormae, Craig Robinson) given this movie would be seen as unnecessary by many and even somewhat disrespectful.  The saving grace here I guess is for a movie that rushed through to be made and maybe shock a bit during a time that was critical to the country...it won't even get a big theatrical release so I can't see it turning a major profit.

Something about Christmas/winter time that puts me in the mood for WWII movies.,"For several years around the holiday season, I always go through a phase of watching war and historical films. War dramas have always been a favorite genre of mine, but there's something about the holidays that brings out my inner history nerd. It usually starts with my own little tradition of watching *Tora! Tora! Tora!* every December 7th, after that I just go through all my favorite WWII films. Do any of you out there do something similar for this time of  year, or for another holiday?",movies,1607645537,EastClintwood89,True,1,3,2020-12-10
Scenes in movies that would never get the green light today (e.g. unintentionally creepy/sexualising children),"Police Academy: Mahoney is standing outside what appears to be a dormitory watching naked women shower while drinking a beer. Lieutenant Harris interrupts him, at which point Mahoney skulks off. Harris looks into the building at which point the women scream and Harris runs off. Really odd scene. Mahoney's behaviour isn't even presented as being funny; he's just silently staring at naked women. Very creepy.

The Last Boy Scout: Near the start of the movie, Bruce Willis's protagonist makes a comment to his wife about his 12 year old daughter having sex with guys by the time she's 14. Later in the movie, Willis brings Damon Wayans sidekick home and introduces him to his daughter. The very precocious daughter engages in a screaming match with Willis and is sent to her bedroom. A few moments later, Willis kicks the troubled Wayans out of his home after discovering him doing lines of cocaine in the bathroom. Upon leaving the house, Wayans is greeted by Willis's daughter who is now wearing make up for some reason. She flirts with him and asks for his autograph (he's a former quarterback). 

Maybe this doesn't count but....

Face/Off: At the start of the movie, Nicolas Cage's character gropes an underage choir girl. Later in the movie, after switching faces with John Travolta, Cage flirts with his ""daughter"" and gives her relationship advice. The daughter, who up until this moment has had a fractious relationship with her father, appears weirdly receptive to her ""father"".

The dad of the main character made a machine that made circles. And the main character had a dream of being in a whale In the beginning the two people are reading a newspaper and eating crackers. She finds a weird book that’s soaking wet and there is something inside it she hangs it up to dry for the night. She has a weird clock with a tiny dude in it that knocks at the window That wakes her up in the morning. In the beginning after the two animals complaining we got the opening shot off the main characters house. There was this sene where I think was the main characters dad was kids and he was digging in a sand box and found his feature wife or whatever he also made a machine to cut carrots in a good way and a scene where she talks to a kinda sold man about one of those pocket watches

Need help finding a title of a certain old(ish) spy movie,"I think that given the sparsity of information I can provide, my question might be impossible to answer, but still some hope remains that there is a spy movie enthusiast out there that can help me.

When I was a kid, I watched a movie set in cold war, happening in Eastern Europe, most likely in Russia. The protagonist was an underdog of some sort, chasing after some dangerous folk  trying to blow their network. But he was an able man, maybe retired, and not given full resources for the job.

I can only remember this brief scene, which was most probably the story climax:

A protagonist is in a cheap car (a Lada probably) following another guy, who was dangerous and armed (and in a better car - possibly black color). But the protagonist wasn't armed. So when the bad guy entered a public restroom in a railway station (could be a bus station), the protagonist had to follow him on foot, but having no weapon at hand he improvised and un-screwed the gear shift lever from his Lada as a club weapon, and hide it under his trench coat. He had a white or beige trench coat (or a rain coat). The weather was grey and rainy, the city was bleak and run-down. He carefully followed the bad guy into the restrooms, and due to circumstances, had to use the gear shift lever to defend himself and knock the bad guy out.

The movie was in color, and I think the characters spoke Russian. 

I'm sorry, I really can't remeber anything else. Can somebody help?",movies,1607301258,auda-85-,True,1,5,2020-12-06

Titanic Easter egg?,"So. I come from the same place as James Cameron (a small village within the city of Niagara Falls Canada called Chippawa). 

I’ve never seen titanic, but it was on tv recently and I noticed Leo’s character says he’s from ‘Chippewa Falls Wisconsin’ which is indeed a real place, however, I wonder if that was chosen because James Cameron himself is from chippawa in Canada?",movies,1607301906,rougekhmero,True,1,5,2020-12-06

I HAVEN’T SEEN (pretty much any movie)!,"This was a fun discussion on Facebook, so I hope you guys will have fun with it as well. 

I’m 39. Most of my life, I’ve only watched the same few movies over and over. I was married for 15 years and my ex wife only enjoyed watching scary/ghost/horror movies, leaving me a middle aged man who hasn’t seen MOST of the movies that everybody else considers “must see”. 

The one I use as an example to drive the point home is Schindler’s List. Most people have seen it. I haven’t. There are MANY MANY others though. 

My Girlfriend took notes of the suggestions on the post I made of Facebook and we have a list, but I’m sure you guys have some that didn’t make that list of movies to eventually watch. So far we’ve checked a few off, but there are many more yet to come. 

So, give me your suggestions for movies everybody SHOULD have seen, Reddit! Thanks in advance! 🤙🏻🤙🏻",movies,1607302268,THExREALxTACOgg,True,1,63,2020-12-06

It's really interesting how a movie can be identified with the use of such simple symbols. I think those who don't have the means to create storyboards themselves can use emojis to pitch their product in the future.

List of the archival footage sourced for the documentary The Atomic Cafe?,"I've wondered about this for a while.  Essentially all of the footage used in this docu-movie came from contemporaneously-produced propaganda, newsreels, etc.  But there's no list out there detailing exactly what the individual elements are.

I can only name four, myself: _Operation Ivy,_ Eisenhower's 1953 state of the union address, _Duck and Cover,_ and _Troop Test Smoky,_ the latter of which I only know because it was mentioned by name in a somewhat recent [article](https://www.texasobserver.org/atomic-cafe-documentary-sxsw-cold-war-nuclear/) about the movie.

Peppered throughout _The Atomic Cafe_ are all kinds of old propaganda films, many animated.  Those are probably easy to identify, though, again, there is no list.  More confoundingly, the editing of the movie obscures these details further.  For example, the aforementioned state of the union address by Eisenhower is presented in the movie in almost montage format: Initially, we see [a film of Eisenhower's address](https://youtu.be/lF0r1OdDIME?t=2328), which, as far as I can tell, cannot be found anywhere online outside of _The Atomic Cafe_ itself.  But soon we hear some [1950s orchestral music play](https://youtu.be/lF0r1OdDIME?t=2348) in concert with the address, and the visuals transition to some heavily color-washed film of Americana.  The source of this music is apparently one of the nuclear test documentaries... but which one?  What's the name of it?

Anyway, that's the gist of it.  I think it would be interesting to be able to watch all of these individual sources in their entirety, but in order to do that, I need to start with their names.",movies,1607303310,Fredasa,True,1,6,2020-12-06

Name a bad remake/reboot to a good movie,"I think whenever a new remake/reboot is announced these days, movie fans tend to roll their eyes and groan. Why fix something that isn't broken? And look, even when remakes are bad, they're mostly bad in a forgettable way. For instance, look at the 2015 Poltergeist remake. Nobody talks about this movie anymore. Instead, people talk about the original 1982 Tobe Hooper Poltergeist. The same goes for 2001's Planet of the Apes remake directed by Tim Burton. The ape makeup is beautiful and I love seeing Tim Roth chew the scenery, but the movie just isn't good. It's now a smudge on Burton's filmography.

Ready Player One underestimates what real gamers can possibly do. (SPOILER WARNING),"This movie is intriguing in itself, hollywood is trying to produce a movie about gamers in their own knowledge. What strikes me off is that its a weird concept to make a (VR)game that mixes pop culture with modern video games which might come of as niche to everyday gamers, but OASIS(or VR gaming as a whole)portraying as a revolutionary product is a concept indistinguishable from reality, the video game industry is growing FAST(like REALLY FAST) and it is implied to me more profitable than any other media market, VR gaming is the next step though it's still in its early stages of its profitability but its getting there. Disclaimer: haven't read the book so most of my opinions are from the movie, bear with me :/  


So Halliday makes a challenge to all players in OASIS, whoever gets the three keys gets to own the Gregarious Games itself(which is worth a whopping Trillion dollars) and full control of the OASIS itself. The first challenge seems direct and simple enough, just some good old racing challenge, but the true solution to win the race is hilarious, *just go backwards*. With that many participants in the race, surely there must be at least one player fooling around and just go backwards for no reason, even an ordinary player can figure this out. Mind you this took literal **YEARS** to figure this out when in reality it can be figured out in *less than an hour*, not even counting that some hardcore players may search for some bugs and glitches to perform a ""glitch run"" to properly win but since OASIS seems like a very polished game I can understand that might not be the case.  


Second challenge riddle could've been deciphered easily by anonymous players assuming anyone can get a copper key item and solve on their own, they could've cracked the clue to the Shining challenge before Parzival and his team can unless they don't know Halliday's history, now we get to the **IOI pop culture research team**. Since there's so many talents involved in solving the challenges surely they can solve the ENTIRE challenge in less than a month? no, somehow some anonymous gunter solved the first challenge before an entire team of experts, either this team is incompetent or they haven't got their bearings on the challenge yet.  


I understand that it took quite a bit of time to solve the third challenge, its a literal gamble, hundreds of games and only one of them you can win, it is implied that you only have one try to solve the challenge but IOI cheated through this with their Sixers, though this is easy to solve too, since the challenge is all about the 90s anyone could've guessed the small piece of trivia that the Atari game ***Adventure has the first ever easter egg*** in video game history, let alone an entire team of pop culture ""experts"", Parzival solved this on his own.   


We've come to the conclusion, hollywood doesn't really understand real gamers yet but this take already impressed me, IOI doing all its can to take the rights of OASIS to their company for ads and microtransactions seems akin to what EA could do, VR gaming to escape reality is a possible future and its scary. To be honest the entire challenge could be solved in under a year or even a few months because the challenges seems so very simple, in real life many video game companies made *heavily cryptic messages* or teasers as promotion to new games are events, much more cryptic than the entire egg hunt challenge and these are still solved in under a week. 

TBH the entire challenge could've been cut short by a game developer's worst nightmare, **datamining,** unless the OASIS is THAT heavily protected.

I'm open to criticisms for any oversights I might've overlooked since this is my first time sharing an opinion about my favorite movie. Anyways, hopefully my review isn't shite :/",movies,1607304343,kirbyverano123,True,1,14,2020-12-06

Fight Club and Revolutionary Road,"When I first watched Fight Club back as a teenager the message I took was consumerism and masculinity. Then recently, after a rewatch, what I took away was the mental health that is created by the destruction of the nuclear family unit. Now I’m not saying being raised by a single mom/dad will make us all insane anarchists, just hear me out, then I’ll tie it in with Revolutionary Road.

That bathtub conversation scene between the narrator and Tyler is really insightful: they felt abandonment, they lacked a proper father figures in their lives, and what they did get from their fathers was: go to college, get a job, get married, but what they really learnt from their fathers was start a franchise by starting something else where while abandoning what’s here.

So they started fight club to feel connected (abandonment shuts them up from having real connections in a normal way), find “masculinity” by proving that they’re real men by dishing and receiving pain in forms of beating the crap outta one another, and rejecting their fathers’ advise of living a “normal” life with first Fight Club and then project Mayham. Fight Club and project Mayham may be targeting consumerism/capitalism, but really it was their way to get back at their fathers (in the form of the authorities of society and rejecting the previous generations bequeathed way of life as the solution to their problems because it doesn’t).

The truth is I doubt that Tyler would ever feel complete if he did successfully accomplish project Mayham. He would probably just upped the scale with something else.

What’s interesting is that the more they rebelled, the more Tyler became like his father. That is, abandoning the narrator to start something else somewhere else. Hence, Fight Club, the franchise. 

In experiencing this abandonment from Tyler, the narrator also realized he has a real connection with Marla Singer and didn’t want to abandon her the same way Tyler/his father did to him. Accepting that he cares for her and actually loves her made him decide to want to be with her. This realization then led the narrator to the climax where he made the choices to break free of his own mental and delusional shackles.

However, the narrator and Marla herself, both of whom have deeper issues that need addressing. Without which, their relationship will ultimately fall apart. The narrator would probably end up leaving her and becoming not that much different from his own father. Marla might end up raising up another generation of Tyler Durdens on her own.

That being said, I think Marla Singer being the motivation for the narrator to change is a little bit of a copout and even cliche. It is justifiable, since I just explained it previously, but at the same time, it doesn’t provide a solution with the deeper issues lay inside the characters.

That being said, I think a spiritual sequel to Fight Club is actually Revolutionary Road since the story is really about a couple with underlying issues behind their psyches that is not that much different then the narrator, Tyler, and even Marla: abandonment from fathers, feeling in their own way being “the lost generation”, a lack of sense of purpose or fulfillment, bought into the American dream, and depression.

What is the best Herbie movie?,"As a kid, I remember seeing commercials on Disney Channel for Herbie: Fully Loaded with Lindsay Lohan. I didn't think much of it at the time, but then I started watching this review series called ""Disneycember"" where Doug Walker aka the Nostalgia Critic reviews a bunch of Disney movies. He eventually got to the 1968 movie, [The Love Bug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYBnwNXdJzw) which I found out was the first Herbie movie. I had no idea Herbie was this established Disney franchise. He then made a video where he dug into the Herbie [sequels/remakes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOnF2JKsS3c) and was surprised that there's a remake directed by Peyton Reed (Ant-Man) that stars Bruce Campbell. Ash Williams drove Herbie. Isn't that weird? With that said, if you've seen all the Herbie movies, which one do you think is the best?

"I absolutely loved Black Bear, but can anyone clarify a few things for me?","Obviously, it's a film that is mostly entirely up to interpretation. 

I loved both halves, and thought Plaza was fucking on FIRE in the second half. I don't know if she was actually drunk, or just a great actress, but either way, she deserves some awards recognition for it. But I expect this film will be too challenging/polarizing for many, so she'll probably be ignored. She's like Gena Rowlands- Woman Under The Influence spectacular. 

Anyway, can someone better explain how the two halves compliment each other? Is the first half just an actual film idea she had in her head that we saw her start to write at the property? Only seen as how she would actually direct it?

Then the second half we see it's Abbott directing, and they are married now, and he's gaslighting her with the other actress to get a better performance from her at the cost of her sanity/sobriety, basically. 

Then it ends with her finding them having sex (which mirrors the first half only the roles are reversed), she sees the bear and walks to it, and then we see her on the dock again, she goes to write, and it ends. 

So was the second half the inspiration for the story in the first half in her mind? They cheated, so she makes the roles reverse, makes the other actress pregnant and ultimately losing the child, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I mean I loved the film and it's one of my very favorites of the year, I'll definitely be re-watching it this weekend, but I'm just trying to figure some things out, or hear some other theories? And how the part 1 and part 2 connect. But DAMN, such amazing performances! 

Also, did this remind anyone else of Queen of Earth by Alex Ross Perry? Creative people in a cabin, one losing her mind, everyone at each others necks, and a mental breakdown? Yet they are two entirely original films.",movies,1607121734,atclubsilencio,True,3,23,2020-12-04

Bad fight choreography in tenet,"While I thought the movie was petty good there were a number of instances where the fight choreography was kinda bad. Mostly due to the person receiving the attack making it look obviously fake. 

When the protagonist jumps onto the balcony and chokes out the guard it looks like amateur community theater. There were also a few punches where it didn't look like there was any contact. The timing and reaction were just off somehow.

Why was Liv Ullman such a huge influence for Ingmar Bergman?,"What so interesting about liv is one she was the only major foreign actor(Norwegian not Swedish)that work with him, even after they broke up he still casted her the lead in the last significant movies of his career thought the 1970s in the except Fanny  and alexander( which was her fault since she turned the role down and later regretted it) and the touch. Not to mention she was the actress that worked the most with him with 10 movies despite being the last one to join his troupe of actors. Bergman style of filmmaking completely changed after person because of her and he started to focus more on strong female characters played by liv  and less on max von sydow(who played the gender swapped role as the supporting spouse role to liv.  A position was traditionally played by females).

What is the best Ernest movie?,"Ernest P. Worrell is a character portrayed by the late Jim Varney. The Ernest character has appeared in commercials, TV shows, and movies.

What's your all time favorite acting performance?,"It doesn't have to be male, but what is in your opinion the best acting performance you've ever seen in a movie. I have a few opinions but I'd love to see what this subreddit is interested in and what they love.

There are a lot of great examples throughout the decades and I am excited to check out some movies that I may not have seen before. For me, it might be Al Pacino in Godfather Part II as Michael Corleone. He's fantastic in that and it's very subtle with a lot of power in the physical composure of his face. I never really thought of acting with your eyes until I saw Pacino in the first movie in the restaurant, and then *that* scene in part II with Kay. He's an all time great.

What are the most unrelatable films you've ever watched?,"I was reading a post about Sofia Coppola having her art tainted by the insulation of her wealthy lifestyle, always about bored affluent people having issues. Someone mentioned This is 40, hard to relate to wealthy people with problems. It reminded me that we're really into that... watching Big Little Lies, wealthy women with problems, same with housewives, or same with Succession. I hate BLL, I love Succession. I think being in a family business tempers the absurd unrelatable affluence and makes it more about the dynamics in the family, and I enjoy that.

But there's SO MUCH tone-deaf and unrelatable film out there. Some feels like you are watching an insecure student film trying to be pretentious, some just feels like it's out of touch with reality.

Anyway for those who don't know Mank is "" is a 2020 American biographical drama film about screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz and his development of the script for Citizen Kane (1941). Directed by David Fincher, based on a screenplay by his late father Jack Fincher, the film is produced by Ceán Chaffin, Douglas Urbanski, and Eric Roth. It stars Gary Oldman in the title role, Amanda Seyfried, Lily Collins, Arliss Howard, Tom Pelphrey, Sam Troughton, Ferdinand Kingsley, Tuppence Middleton, Tom Burke, Joseph Cross, Jamie McShane, Toby Leonard Moore, Monika Gossmann, and Charles Dance.

Fincher's father Jack wrote the script in the 1990s, and David originally intended to film it after he completed The Game (1997), with Kevin Spacey and Jodie Foster as the leads. It never came to fruition, and Jack Fincher died in 2003. Eventually, the project was officially announced in July 2019, and filming took place around Los Angeles from November 2019 to February 2020.

Mank had a limited theatrical release on November 13, 2020, and began streaming on Netflix on December 4, 2020. The film received positive reviews from critics, who praised the direction, cinematography, production values, and musical score, as well as the performances of Oldman and Seyfried.

007 Quantum of Solace has some of the best directed action scenes I have ever seen,"As much as this movie is trashed, I'm suprised nobody was talking about action pieces. It has the most in-your-face dynamic fights and chases of the entire franchise, that should be appreciated more.

It wears that post-Bourne shaky-cam style, but unlike many inexperienced directors, who were misusing this technique to hide the bullshit, Marc Forster is actually using it to its full advantage. I never had trouble following what's going on onscreen, despite all the shakes and angles. While it may be jumpy, many shots catch intensity on Bond's face and I always had the feeling he's making split-second intuitive decicions on the spot. That action feels organic and brutal to the point it never feels choreographed.

Whatever you think of Quantum of Solace as a movie I believe its action deserves more recognition, because it's clearly superb. If you're still having trouble enjoying it, because this 007 goes with brute force instead of fancy gadgets - just forget it's a James Bond movie and enjoy manly piece of cinema with beer and some snacks on lazy Sunday evening.",movies,1607134136,Uncle_Spenser,True,0,28,2020-12-04

Why do people hate movie theaters now,"I was watching Mank on my Tiny Tv in my dormroom, as my neighbor blared the soundtrack to High School musical 2 on a sunny day,while watching this film I got this feeling of sadness, the same kind of feeling you feel you feel when you lost a friend, and I realized that This is the type of movie that is meant to be experienced in a theater, yet I never will get to see it in a theaters, as it dead. 

Maybe it's because iv'e never been a fan of streaming to begin with, and the movie theater was my home away from home but I've never understood why pepole have gotten a hatred for movie theaters and feel they have no value. Because to me I think their still alot of value. I feel like pepole are forgotten that in small towns and rural states, The movie theater is alot of the towns only from of escape.

Like growing up in boring old iowa with not much enteriment The movie I feel was a espcae for many pepole I knew, they would go to the big blockbuster movies in droves along side the smaller movies. It was a place were everyone went on dates too, and were many day cares took kids too. 

I also feel their are dozens of movies that can only fully appreciated in a movie theater. For example The Rocky Horror Picture Show is really only fun if you see it with a crowed and intact with the film, with out it it's kind of just a boring fun. Another one is Mad Max Furry road, Watching it home is not the same as seeing it in the theater with its massive epic cinematography on a big screen with the sound blasting.

"My Thoughts on ""The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone""","A few hours ago I saw Francis Ford Coppola's revised version of ""The Godfather Part III."" Released as ""The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone,"" this new cut features a different beginning and ending while running 12 minutes shorter than the original. I've always had mixed feelings about Part III: to me there was never any doubt that the cinematography, the dialogue, Andy Garcia's performance, and the operatic climax were pure gold. But the convoluted plot, absence of Robert Duvall, and Sofia Coppola's underwhelming performance had long made ""Part III"" a frustrating viewing experience for me.

After watching ""The Death of Michael Corleone,"" I was still left wondering what might have been if Duvall and Winona Ryder, the original choice to play Mary Corleone, had been able to leave their mark on the conclusion to the Godfather saga. Yet Coppola's new edit of the film transformed a flawed crime drama into a compelling - even moving - epic that I loved practically from beginning to end. Coppola restructures the narrative of ""Part III"" by placing Michael's dealings with the Vatican front and center, which clarifies the plot while making the Don's doomed quest for redemption the overarching theme of the film. Although the original cut suffered from an uneven focus on a cluttered cast of characters, ""The Godfather Coda"" is absolutely Michael's story. The new cut forces us to see the world through his eyes as the disgraced Mafioso tries to salvage what is left of his family while attempting to absolve himself of his past sins. 

I won't give away the new ending, but I found it far more nuanced and emotionally satisfying than the much-mocked finale of the original version. I also came away with more respect for what Coppola had sought to accomplish with Part III: he had wanted to make an epilogue that enhanced the original films, rather than a ""Part III"" that would equal two of the greatest movies ever made. While it may have taken Coppola 30 years to realize his vision, the wait was well worth it. ""The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone"" is a riveting tragedy that still is not quite as good as Godfather 1 and 2, but nonetheless a worthy finale to the Corleone story.",movies,1607135777,realjatchue98,True,16,66,2020-12-04

My 12 year old is pissed at me because he accidentally proved that Die Hard is indeed a Christmas movie. [SPOILERS],"Last year, I introduced him to Die Hard and I said it was one of my favorite Christmas movies. All year long, he has been trying to argue that it's not a Christmas movie per se, it's just a movie that happens at Christmastime. 

My argument was that the whole reason John McClane was even in Los Angeles was to see his family for Christmas and the only reason he was at Nakatomi Plaza was for the Xmas party. He wasn't having it. 

So tonight I introduced Lethal Weapon, which honestly, I had forgotten was also set around Christmas. But there we are, watching the opening credits and they're playing jingle bell rock, everything is decorated for Xmas, everyone's saying ""Merry Christmas"" to each other. So I start saying ""look, another Christmas movie like Die Hard!"" because I know he's going to argue that it's not. 

He impressed me this time: he said that if you take Christmas out, it doesn't change the story. And he's 100% right; Lethal Weapon can stand on its own without the story changing even if it happens in the third week of August. Christmas is not at all integral to any part of that movie. 

So I pointed out that Gruber's gang in Die Hard needed the reduced security and number of employees in the building for a nighttime Christmas party for them to get into the building easier, but they also needed enough employees at the party to create a hostage situation that would get the FBI out so they could turn off the power, letting them drill into the vault. 

You take Xmas out and they don't have their opportunity to make their heist. 

And again, McClane is in that building specifically because it's Christmas. 

No Christmas, no Die Hard. 

He's not happy about it. 

So tomorrow we're going to have to watch Love Actually and see what he thinks.",movies,1607135857,gynoceros,True,3625,3313,2020-12-04

Scary movies recommendations for a 12 year old girl,"I'm sponsoring a foster child for Christmas and she has requested scary movies! 

I only know that she's 12 and female, and I don't have kids of my own so I don't know what is ""too scary"" or adult for a 12 year old.

Would y'all be willing to recommend some ideas? I'm happy to buy her 4 or 5 DVDs. I guess I could give her an amazon gift card and let her pick but it seems more fun to recommend specific movies to her.

What are your favorite scenes from animated films?,"As a fan of animation, I've always found great animated scenes to be especially important to me. So I wanted to open a discussion about it.  

The 'Spider-verse' What's Up Danger scene is probably the most recent of my favorites, it's just really well animated and directed. But I think what makes the scene stick is the music which is incredibly well-composed. Props to Blackaway and Black Caviar for that!  

These are partly here because of nostalgia but I genuinely think Kung Fu Panda 2's parting gift and tower scenes are some of the best animation I have seen they're fucking gorgeous. Also, Shen is the guy  

My absolute favorite is definitely Your Name's Date 2 scene. It's my favorite film, and I just find it very touching. The cinematography and the low-key color choices just contribute to a very emotional scene for me paired with how much I feel for the main-character

Even then I believe it is one of the best story to come out in recent years. Maybe even Nolan's best. So I made a guide to for you. This post contains serious spoilers. You have been warned.

PART 2 : The heist 

**Characters:**

 

1. The Protagonist (real name not revealed) | CIA Black OPs - I will call him TP
2. Neil (Robert Pattinson) | CIA Black OPS
3. Katherine (Elizabeth ) | Art Dealer | Wife of Andrei Sator
4. Priya (Dimple Kapadia)
5. Andrei Sator | Russian Oligach (made his fortune in selling Plutonium) | has contact with the future humans
6.  Ives | Australian Agent | works for Priya | Commander of the red team in final scene

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Jargon:**

*Temporal pincer movement*: In military strategy pincer movement is when an army surrounds opposite army on both sides (left and right).  In temporal pincer movement,  Sator's team moves forward in time as an event happens. Then they travel back in time going through the same event knowing exactly what and how the event happens so they can change the event.

 *Inverted objects*: Objects that moving backwards in time. how? In the future humans have created a machine (turnstiles ) that reverses the entropy of an object. So the arrow of time for that object is reversed. why did the future humans create inverted objects ? Because Earth is not livable in the future so they are trying to make a reversed universe. Where everything goes backwards.

*Freeport*. Its like a warehouse located at the airports with direct access to private planes without going through the customs. A tax haven in which rich people can store art and antiques. Created by Sator. Importantly Freeport has a turnstile (machine that reverses entropy)

*Plutonium 241* : It is used in nuclear bombs. Here it is one part of ""The Algorithm"",

*The Algorithm*: IT is a formula with nine sections that which is hidden in 9 secret locations in by the future humans. When all parts are brought together at a particular time it would create a bomb that would reverse the arrow of time. The future people chose Sator to collect the 9 parts and explode them.

""*we live in a twilight world..."" -* This is a code word for the CIA black ops in the movie to identify friends.

&amp;#x200B;

**The Heist**

TP offers to steal the Plutonium for Sator in exchange for partnership (TP just wants to know what is Sator's plan). So TP plans to steal the Plutonium 241 from Ukrainian Secret Service while they are transporting it. 

In the heist scene, 4 cars surround the truck carrying the Plutonium and TP retrieves the orange case containing Plutonium. 

After the heist is over, an inverted Sator comes and blackmails TP to give him the Plutonium in exchange for Katherine's life. Suddenly a third inverted car (driven by inverted TP) comes and starts moving between the 2 cars. 

TP throws an empty orange case at Sator. And seeing himself in the inverted car, throws the actual Plutonium in the 3rd car. TP and Neil go to Freeport. Where they see inverted Sator moving back with Katherine. 

**Freeport**

Inside the Freeport they see a  blue area and a red area 

Blue = inverted

Red = normal

&amp;#x200B;

an inverted Sator asks TP where is the Plutonium and shoots Katherine with an inverted bullet to threated TP. TP lies that the Plutonium is in the glove box of the car parked outside. Suddenly there are 2 Sators one on the red and one on the blue. Both Sator enter the turnstiles and disappear. 

Where did Sator  go? To explain that I have included a picture. Andrie Sator disappears because he is no longer in the present. He is now moving backwards in time after inverting himself. (as seen in my drawing).

A team of military people come in and it is revealed that Sator was using a temporal Pincer movement. This is why he knew where and how the heist was going to happen. 

Katherine is shot with an inverted bullet so to save her life everyone decides to invert themselves. How will Katherine be saved? Because if inverted the bullet effect will reverse. 

So inverted TP and the team travel back in time. When TP is inverted, he sees that the world seems inverted with respect to his point of view. TP goes chasing after inverted Sator and to get the Plutonium while the rest of the team just sit in a container from the Oslo airport to travel back in time to OSLO a week ago from now. 

Inverted TP reaches the after heist scene where he gets the Plutonium in his car. But Sator sees him and overturns TP's car. Sator lights TP's car on fire but inverted explosion is pushed back by dominant forward moving entropy. Instead of fire, ice forms on the windshield. why? Because heat transfer through inverted objects is reversed. So if heat(forward in time) enters an inverted object; for the inverted object heat was lost(so ice is formed).

&amp;#x200B;

Neil saves TP and everyone goes back to 1 week ago. to OSLO where TP and Neil had tried to steal the painting for Katherine. He reveals to TP that the Algorithm is trying to invert world around us. If that happens, backward entropy would Annihilate forward entropy and the world as we know it

IN the airport, TP enters the turnstiles first clearing the path. Then Neil enters with a healed Katherine and Katherine is saved.

Now TP , Neil and the team is in the past. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Meeting with Priya,**

 TP understands that Priya wanted Sator to get the Plutonium so he would assemble the Algorithm together. Now TP's mission is to retrieve the Assembled algorithm. She also tells of the Algorithms backstory: there was going to be a scientist in the future who would invent this algorithm like Manhattan project invented the atom bomb. Scared that the weapon would wipe out past and the present, she hides the 9 parts of the algorithm in 9 super secret nuclear places. Now someone is communicating with Sator to get the 9 parts and assemble the algorithm to reverse the arrow of time.

Where and when is the algorithm going to be assembled? Stalks 12 (Siberia), a ghost town where Sator grew up (revealed by Sir Michael Crosby)

How will the algorithm explode? There are 2 ways of activation :

1) Sator dies, his fitness tracker would trigger the algorithm remotely

2) drop the assembled algorithm

&amp;#x200B;

Now Katherine has to prevent Sator from dying while TP and the team retrieves the algorithm and disassemble it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Katherine reveals that Sator is dying of cancer and will like to die in Vietnam which was their happiest time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Katherine goes to Vietnam. 

TP and Neil go to Stalks 12

&amp;#x200B;

In Vietnam:

Katherine and Sator (both from the future) come to the boat. But Sator doesn't know that Katherine is also from the future. Katherine kills Sator. 

&amp;#x200B;

In Stalsk 12:

TP and the team launch a temporal pincer attack on the site of dead drop. 

As TP and Ives enter the dead drop site, They encounter a cage which they cannot enter. An inverted Neil(from the future) helps them open the cage and dies in the process. 

TP, Neil and Ives get the Algorithm and disassemble it each keeping one part.

&amp;#x200B;

Neil reveals to TP that TP is the mastermind of all this and in the future will recruit Neil for this task.

Marginalization and film education and discussion,"How many female directors can you name? Sofia Coppola and Greta Gerwig? I might be oversimplifying this a little, but chances are, you know more male directors than you do female directors. Is this a symptom of systemic misogyny, or is this merely a coincidence? Are male the directors the only group of people who can consistently make great films? Should the films of female directors be more, equally, or less promoted than the films of their male counterparts? Also, how about the films of transgender (including trans nb) directors? Should education and discussion of films be furthered concerning the cinema of women and trangender directors? How would this be done? Would it be okay to stop teaching about certain films made by men so long as there is a larger proportion of films made by trans and female directors being taught? Feel free to answer any or all of these questions, or make new ones, but I would like the discussion to keep from straying from these guidelines.",movies,1606953389,gecscx,True,1,47,2020-12-02
A mind bending question about the movie Arrival.,"Everything we see happens as it happens...or does it?

The main character seems oddly depressed at the beginning of the movie, the mood is a cold and sad one, but she knows nothing of the aliens yet...or does she on a subconscious level?

She then comes on the scene, and deciphers the alien language, but then she runs into a situation that will only escalate unless she tells the chinese president something that for some reason only HE knows, by using the aliens time-language she can tell him this information, but HE is the one to tell her in the future at the end of the movie. A bootstrap paradox.

Then she and the doctor who go on to have a child who she knows will die, but she doesn't tell him that, and they split up.

But something feels amiss. I think there is more to crack in this movie than it lets on. A hint of another timeline in there.",movies,1606953493,AmnesiaLabyrinth1-2,True,1,7,2020-12-02

Nicolas Cage and The Rotten Tomatoes Analysis,"Just wanted to discuss an interesting anomaly: actors with extremes in Rotten Tomatoes scores. Most actors are in a variety of quality films but some really play the extremes.

Nicholas Cages was in Leaving Las Vegas (91%) but also Left Behind (1%). That’s pretty wild. What other actors have wildly swinging film scores, a testament to their wide filmography/desperation?",movies,1606955837,rothscorn,True,1,21,2020-12-02

GOOD or BAD: Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes (2001),"I'm a huge fan of the original Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston. My dad showed it to me at a young age and I still love it to this day. It remains one of my favorite sci-fi movies of all time. I also enjoyed the sequels but I never loved them as much as the original. 

Then came Planet of the Apes in 2001. A [""re-imagining""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPgNrHqfTdY) directed by Tim Burton. Going in, I thought the idea of a re-imagined Planet of the Apes was interesting. I know I lot of people roll their eyes at remakes and reboots these days, but I think there's a lot you can do with the concept that can lend itself to a new spin. 

Unfortunately, this movie did not work for me. Yes, the ape makeup is incredible; it is Rick Baker's work after all. I also like how the apes move more like primates than in the original. That was a nice touch. Tim Roth was also very enjoyable to watch as the villain, General Thade. He just chewed so much of the scenery. I'm not going to act like this was a good performance, but I'll take overacting over underacting any day of the week. 

The rest is just a mess. I can appreciate the movie's ambition and production value, but when you're dealing with a shoddy script and bland performances (Tim Roth notwithstanding), you're left with a forgettable movie. 

Regardless, I would have actually been interested in a sequel. Mainly because of the movie's ending, which I won't spoil. But if you want to see, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9ZJ0F8Ik9E). I want to know how a sequel would have carried on after that ending. Unfortunately, we'll never get to see it. 

I'll leave with Roger Ebert's thoughts on the movie, which align with my own. 

&gt;The movie is great-looking. Rick Baker's makeup is convincing even in the extreme closeups, and his apes sparkle with personality and presence. The sets and locations give us a proper sense of alien awe. Tim Burton made a film that's respectful to the original, and respectable in itself, but that's not enough. Ten years from now, it will be the 1968 version that people are still renting.",movies,1606958048,ggroover97,True,1,27,2020-12-02

"Was Avatar's ""White Savior"" plotline really that overdone when it came out?","How many times has the ""White Savior"" narrative from Avatar been done when it came out in 2009?

Whenever the topic of James Cameron's Avatar comes out, I always hear the claim that one of the biggest reasons why the movie is a creation from hell, is that the White Savior narrative has been done to death. And that it is unoriginal and cliched. But I always took this claim with a grain of salt. How many times has the White Savior narrative really been done throughout the history of Hollywood movies? Has it really been done to death or are people just repeating what they've heard?

The only movies that I've seen that had the White Savior storyline (besides Avatar) were Dances With Wolves. That's one movie so far. Then there are the movies that supposedly have the White Savior narrative that I haven't seen. The Last Samurai, Pocahontas, Fern gully: The Last Rainforest, and likely many others.

Let's just say for the sake of argument that there are 20 other ""White guy joins a foreign group and adopts their ways"" movies. Twenty other movies + Fern gully + Pocahontas + Last Samurai + Dances With Wolves = twenty-four movies. 24 movies with that similar plotline. Now how many notable Hollywood movies have come out since the earliest White Savior movie? To Kill A Mockingbird came out in 1962, and is considered by many to be a White Savior movie. So for the sake of argument let's start at 1962. 2009-1962 = 47 years. Safe to assume that at-least 1000 movies came out during those 47 years. 24 / 1000 = .024 ---&gt; Times 100 = 2. Roughly. Even though the number of total movies that have come out in total is way more than 1000, even with 1000, out of 1000, the total movies that have the ""White guy joins the less fortunate group, helps them, and becomes part of them"" is about 2%. 

Now maybe 20 other movies with the ""White guy joins the less fortunate group, helps them, and becomes part of them"" plotline is too low. Let's say 100 movies use that exact plotline (highly doubtful). 100 + 4 other = 104 ----&gt; 104 / 1000 = 10 %.  Roughly. So 2-10 percent of movies with a sample size of 1000 movies, have that similar Avatar plotline. 

Now let's take a look at another movie. Creed (2015). Creed is a sports Drama and sports drama all have pretty much the same premise, give or take a few minor details. A person, usually a guy, wants to become good at a sport, or compete well at some sports event because it will make him or her happy, and or to redeem themselves etc. etc. The guy or girl has a goal, there is a struggle, he gets back up, there is another struggle that is much more serious, but the guy or girl  overcomes it, with the help of some wise person. The guy or girl competes, struggles and wins. And even if he or she loses, it is seen as a ""win"" because he or she accepts something or has become a better person despite the physical loss. Let's call this formulaic story the ""underdog sporty guy"" plotline.

One of the earlier ""underdog sporty guy"" plotline is Rocky from 1976. Creed came out in 2015, so 2015-1976 = 39 years. It is also safe to assume that at-least 1000 movies have come out during those 39 years. It is also safe to assume that at-least 100 ""underdog sporty guy"" movies have come out since 1976. This is because sports movies are so popular and kind of universal (Remember the Titans, Rudy, The Fighter, Warrior etc. etc.) Skipping all the math because the numbers are roughly the same, around 10% of all movies using a sample size of 1000 have the ""underdog sporty guy"" plotline (And again, likely even more than the White Savior plotline, because sports is much more universal of a topic). 

So Creed and Avatar have roughly the same amount of similar movies that have come out before it. Both overdone. Both very cliched. Yet despite that, whenever Creed is criticized, it rarely gets gang-raped with comments of it's overdone plotline and cliched story. The movie rarely gets heavily criticized at all. Yet whenever Avatar gets criticized about, people endlessly grope it left and right, about its cliched and unoriginal story; even though many other movies like Creed are just a rehash and continuation of an already cliched storyline. I personally don't think Avatar is great or terrible. It's an average movie for me. And it is fine to hate it. But if one absolutely hates Avatar, or loves it, there should be a good reason. And ""muh it's a White Savior movie, it's been done to death"" I feel isn't a good reason to hate the movie. Not a good criticism. In fact, from some of the math I did above, I'm inclined to believe that it's not even a true statement. Using the 1000 movie sample size, I got 10%. 10% is not even close to ""been done to death."" The things I don't like about Avatar are some of the dialogue, some plot-holes, runtime is too long, and some others. The Dances With Wolves plotline being supposedly done to death was never an issue for me. 

Does anyone else agree? That Avatar's plot of a White dude saving a disadvantaged group and becoming one of them hasn't actually been done to death? And that it is an invalid criticism and untrue statement?  Has it really been done to death or are people just repeating what they've heard? And is unoriginality even a good criticism for movies?",movies,1606960709,Reasonable_Flan_213,True,1,44,2020-12-02

The Santa Clause 2 is a horrible movie.,"I love 'The Santa Clause.' Sure it doesn't hold up compared to other holiday classics such a 'Jingle All the Way' or 'Elf', but I was appalled at the general storyline of 'The Santa Clause 2'. 

Tim Allen needs to find a wife before Christmas or he won't be Santa anymore. It's the 'Mrs. Clause'. 

Cute.

Now I don't have a problem with the premise, but the way they execute this is horrific. Kris Kringle zeroes in on his target. She is a Principal with HUGE SANTA CLAUS ISSUES. Like literally of all the people he can try to get married to, he is attracted to the poor girl that literally was scarred as a child and still has psychological issues of Santa Claus. He then continues to use his magic to sway the hearts of all of her colleagues and eventually her by procuring all the gifts they wanted at young ages. 

Now, this ploy works hook, line, and sinker until he in fact reveals his secret. He is Santa Claus. Her being a semi-reasonable adult considers him crazy and kicks him out of her house. That is until Charlie's spirit of Christmas is revitalized (he was a spray painting juvenile delinquent the whole movie) and confirms Scott Calvins story.

After Santa, some elf and company retake the North Pole from a fascist dictator robot Santa, the whole north pole basically pressures this poor girl into marrying this guy on the spot. Scott Calvin then goes on to say, well you have known me your whole life.. implying they have had a connection from child hood so it's cool if they bang. 

For some reason this movie gave me total 'Passenger' vibes. That's all I have to say about that.",movies,1606964570,JoeInglesSweatyTaint,True,1,46,2020-12-02

Something that movies should adapt from games,"Give me settings to adjust the volume of dialogue, sound  effects and music separately. I get that the mastering is a stylistic choice by the director and it's great in cinema. But what's great in cinema isn't necessarily practical at home. Earthshaking explosions and banging soundtrack can be a lot of fun. But for late night movie watching at home? I don't want to have to make the choice between being able to understand the dialogue and not waking up all my neighbours. I also don't want to have to always quickly grab the remote to reduce the volume as soon as an action scene comes up. I just want to chill and enjoy the movie. In games I can go into the settings and mix the audio myself and I ALWAYS do it. I wish I could do that in movies too.",movies,1606775905,BaguetteOfDoom,True,1,20,2020-11-30

Otherwise, it was pretty good. Though Sloane sorta-kinda was an unapologetically horrible person. And Harper was a pretty horrible significant other. BUT I GET THAT WAS THE ARC OF THE MOVIE.

Recommendations for 80's corporate yuppie movies?,"Lately I've been fascinated by movies about ambitious business people in corporate 80's America. I love the fashion, the hair, the cluttered offices filled with stacks of paper and ringing phones, the high stakes, the soundtracks, the cars, and the hackneyed business phrases the characters throw around. So far my favorite of this genre has been Working Girl (1988)--it ticks all my boxes.

Some others I've liked are:

Wall Street (1987)

Glengarry Glen Ross (1992)

Nine to Five (1980)

Baby Boom (1987)

American Psycho (2000--not made in the 80's but the yuppie culture was strong and satirical)

Next on my to-watch list is Broadcast News (1987) but I'd love any more recommendations.",movies,1606781731,soontobepegasus,True,1,62,2020-11-30

There is a website called the Internet Movie Script Database (IMSDB.com) where you can read most of your favorite movie scripts for free.,"https://www.imsdb.com  
  
Just thought I would leave this here. There are tons of scripts here. Ones that I have read or plan to read (to give you an idea of what is available): Passengers, 500 Days of Summer, Avatar, Easy A, The Incredibles, Insidious, Scott Pilgrim vs The World, Tropic Thunder, American Psycho, Carrie, Drag Me to Hell, Get Out, Jennifer’s Body, Mulholland Drive, Orphan, and Scream.  
  
It’s really interesting to see how close a final film ended up sticking to the script. And it’s a great tool for helping screenwriters.",movies,1606781867,omgyoucunt,True,1,68,2020-11-30

"Wanted to shout out The Mustang (2019), directed by Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre","Hi everyone!  I hope all of you are doing well and staying safe!  To those of you who celebrate Thanksgiving, I hope you had a happy but safe one, especially considering how crazy things have been lately.

I wanted to shout out the 2019 film the Mustang directed by Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre if you are looking for a random film to watch because there are so many films I want to recommend to this subreddit, such as A Monster Calls, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Eighth Grade, etc. but I have noticed there are already a few posts made on them recommending them to others.  However, I searched up r/movies's search bar and noticed the only posts created on The Mustang were mostly trailers and there were almost no reviews or recommendation posts made and wanted to talk about it.

I stumbled upon this film in a cinema by chance without knowing what it was about, ended up deciding to see it and really loved it, but noticed it wasn't really talked about it or mentioned much anywhere.

Although I would like to recommend this to everyone, for those of you who are extremely into slice of life films, I wanted to genuinely recommend this film to you especially because this film is really driven by a collection of moments over a plot.  Without spoiling anything, the basic plot is following an incarcerated convict who participates in a rehabilitation program for training horses, and although the film due to its slice of life style kinda lacks a narrative for this reason, it makes the film really special.  Matthias Schoenaerts's performance as the protagonist, Roman, is really interesting.  &gt;!Because the film doesn't have a ton of dialogue, a lot of it relies on his facial cues and gestures, but he really brings the character of a convict looking for redemption, forgiveness, and new identity beautifully and hauntingly. !&lt; Although their screentimes are short in the film, Bruce Dern and Gideon Adlon are great as well as the rancher and the daughter.

Personally, though, as amazing as I thought this film was overall, the most impressive thing about the film was probably the screenplay because I was astonished at how fascinating the characters were and how moving the story was even though the film has minimal dialogue, is only 96 minutes long, doesn't &gt;!try to pull any huge twists or major action sequences,!&lt;and mostly focuses on the relationship between a person and their mustang the whole time.  It's so interesting to see what can be expressed in so little, especially in films like these, and I definitely hope we get to see more films like The Mustang in the future.

I truly hope those of you who do see this film really enjoy it like I did and that you all have a great time with upcoming films that you all plan on watching.

What scenes or moments from movies have genuinely impacted your life?,"There's a monologue about love at the end of *Call Me By Your Name* that I still think about regularly and changed the way I approach heartbreak and emotional pain. Even as a straight guy I think that movie is the best depiction of first love I've ever seen. Incredibly touching and memorable. Spoilers below for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I'd very much recommend it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""*You had a beautiful friendship. Maybe more than a friendship. And I envy you. In my place, most parents would hope the whole thing goes away, to pray that their sons land on their feet. But I am not such a parent. In your place, if there is pain, nurse it. And if there is a flame, don’t snuff it out. Don’t be brutal with it. We rip out so much of ourselves to be cured of things faster than we should that we go bankrupt by the age of thirty and have less to offer each time we start with someone new. But to make yourself feel nothing so as not to feel anything. What a waste...*  
&gt;  
&gt;*...Remember, our hearts and our bodies are given to us only once. And before you know it, your heart is worn out, and, as for your body, there comes a point when no one looks at it, much less wants to come near it. Right now, there's sorrow, pain. Don't kill it and with it the joy you've felt.""*

“Thelma &amp; Louise” (1991) is a perfect example of a great direction making the most of an already brilliant script,"""Thelma &amp; Louise"" is probably one of the movies I’ve seen the most and yet it never ceases to amaze me. On my latest rewatch, I got the feeling that the main reason this film became such a classic is because it has not only an amazing script, but a direction that understands everything that’s great about the story and is also able to take it further on its own merits. 

Callie Khouri’s screenplay hits all the right notes when it comes to portraying the friendship of two very different women (Louise being hardened by her traumatic past and emotionally distant, Thelma sheltered by an – awful – domestic life and inexperienced in the world) who find their freedom in unexpected ways. Each of them have their own arc. They don’t always see eye to eye, but their loyalty to each other and what they discover along the way leads them to develop and mature as individuals. Essentially, the script is about the journey (literal and metaphorical) of these two very realized characters finding their own path and their true selves. 

Then there’s Ridley Scott’s direction, taking this intimate story into another level. He never loses sight of the script's core (the bond between the characters and their personal growth), but there’s something about his directorial choices that turn “Thelma &amp; Louise” into an American epic. I kept noticing how he frames the landscapes, the desert and even the Grand Canyon (acting as the location for that iconic final scene). He even pauses in crucial moments to show the women contemplating the scenery or crossing paths with ordinary people, and by doing so he turns this into a movie about a whole country (or parts of a country, at least). 

That’s important because, in the script, there's a lot to be read between the lines about how women are failed by society (even in drastic circumstances such as being discredited in the face of sexual assault). They see no opportunities in the country/society they’re leaving behind - on some level, the movie is an inversion of the American dream, since crossing the border to Mexico is their ideal of salvation and their vague hope of finding a better life. The epicness of the direction makes that message clear without turning ""Thelma &amp; Louise"" into a ""message movie"", because even though the scale is grand, the intimacy on the character's portrayal is never lost or relegated to the background.

"Tom Hanks is an ""Invisible"" Movie Star","I think that Tom Hanks is truly an underappreciated gem. Don't get me wrong, I know a lot of people respect him, but I don't know anyone who actually gets excited for the new ""Tom Hanks film"". I think this is because Tom Hanks truly becomes his character. Whenever I watch a movie with him, I don't see Tom Hanks as that character, I just see that character. Compare that to other actors such as Denzel Washington, Leonardo DiCaprio or Samuel L. Jackson for example, you often see them as themselves, along with many of their own mannerisms, playing a role.

I single out Tom Hanks in particular since his name is known world-wide and is in such a huge number of films. I know there are a lot of bit actors and possibly other big name actors who can go largely unnoticed in a film, but I just wanted to share my appreciation for Hanks in particular.

The major thing was the scene where Mickey after being interviewed walks around telling a joke before grabbing a firearm...like seriously?  This is one of the most wanted men in America who is out of his cell without handcuffs or restraints who not only killed 50+ before going to prison but has killed several while in this prison  walking around needs multiple guards with firearms, guards which hes take on before, telling a suspiciously random joke in the middle of a riot out there.... it was the first part of the movie where I really didn't feel bad ""innocent"" people were getting killed.

Amy Adams’s performance in Arrival was worthy of an Oscar - and she wasn’t even nominated! What gives?,"I know it’s been said before so this is really just me venting more than anything - but her performance was inexplicably under appreciated. I just watched it again and enjoyed it just as much, if not more, than I have the previous four times. 

She was (imo) “better” in Arrival than she was in either of her GG winning roles for American Hustle and Big Eyes. I enjoyed both but neither came close to leaving the mark she and Arrival has/does. Her genius has been recognized before with deserved nominations in several supporting roles (The Fighter, Vice, The Master and Doubt) but apparently the Academy just doesn’t think she’s capable of leading. Which amazes me. 

She carries the film. A film which was nominated for *eight* Oscars. A film which I’d argue is possibly the very best in her phenomenal career. It doesn’t surprise me that Hollywood fell over themselves heaping praise on La La Land - but for her to not even be nominated is an incredible snub. 

How can that movie be nominated for eight awards and none of them be for her performance?  It’d be one thing if the Academy just didn’t care for the film whatsoever - but for everyone involved *but* her to be nominated just doesn’t make any sense. 

It was one of those performances where you (I) can’t picture anyone else on earth doing as good of a job. What more can an actor do? Robbed. Robbed I say!

Can someone please help me to find the title of this movie?,"Hi everyone!

First, I hope you're all doing well and safe! 

A few years ago I watched this movie and I'd love to see it again, but I have no clue what the title is...

I've tried googling and using other sites to figure this thing out, so I'm hoping you can help me out🤞

About the movie (from what I remember)

Four kids (the oldest and youngest are girls, the middele ones are boys), who have lived with there parents in Afrika (I thought Kenia?) for years are taken to the US because their parents unfortunately have passed away. 

The kids are taken in by family friends. The dad is a musician and has this drumset in the house and learns the guys how to play games with a soccer table. De oldest daughter is very protective over her siblings, and feels like she has to stand up and make sure her siblings are doing okay.

At one point the two oldest kids get dropped of at (high) school on their first day of school, and the something like: this is America, go big or go home. Which causes the kids to turn around to actually to go home.

I also remember them playing a board game in the kitchen from the country where they used to live. And the boys slept in the basement where the dad has his music table and his computer to produce his music. 

Unfortunately I forgot wat the mum did for a living, but hopefully this information will be enough for someone to identify this movie 😊


I really hope someone is able to tell me the tilte of this movie 🙈

[Serious] Does anyone know the name of this movie?,"Basically it opens with this bald white skinny guy who bets cash to get into an MMA ring. Everyone thinks he’s the underdog. He warns his opponent not to hit his face but during the fight his opponent does, and the white guy ruins him. An Asian woman was watching him in the crowd and they went to her home together. He ends up paralyzing her with this green injection and kills all her body guards. Throughout the movie there’s also a detective who is close to getting him and the white guy shoots his pregnant wife when they are on a date.

Issue with infinity war and endgame,"My issue goes like this: in infinity war. Tony stark alone fought thanos with many stones and literally held his own for quite awhile. Fast forward to endgame. Tony now has a better suit, captain America, AND Thor with mjolnir and stormbreaker. Thanos has no stones, but literally kicks the hell out of all of them without breaking a sweat. See what I mean here? Thor and stormbreaker literally overpowered thanos with ALL the stones in infinity war. But Thor and stormbreaker can’t take him on with ZERO stones in endgame. Makes no sense to me. 

Another point I have is with infinity war. When thanos beat hulk. Hulks strength is limitless and grows the more pissed off he gets. Thanos might have had him in the first half, but there’s no way you can tell me hulk just accepted his loss. The hulk I know would’ve gotten up and kept trying. No matter how strong thanos is, hulk is always stronger. No amount of training will stop a full potential pissed off hulk.

I am not a proponent of rebooting everything, but I feel this movie could have an interesting modern take. I love how the premise of the ""Genie"" the Western world is familiar with, is turned on it's head. The origins and truth behind the myths are far darker. Granting people's simple wishes, with an imaginative, and typically fatal catch makes for a good popcorn horror/thriller.

Some of my favorite wishes:

When the art appraisal boss wishes for $1M, and the scene cuts to his mother listing him as the beneficiary of her $1M life insurance payout, then cuts to her boarding a plane that explodes on takeoff. Twisted.

Another is when the Black store clerk is helping him, and he asks her if she'd like to be beautiful forever. She shyly agrees, and the scene cuts to him leaving, and a mannequin standing where she was standing.

The movie is **SUPER** cheesy, and the dialogue is absolutely dreadful, but the Djinn is very convincing and intimidating in his role. I love how throughout the movie, they play up on the fact that he's thousands of years old, and is aloof about technology and social standards. This movie is similar to the Saw series, but with wishes instead of traps. Basically, you're fucked no matter what most of the time.

Oh, and get the original Djinn actor if he isn't dead or geriatric! He was perfectly creepy with the way he exaggerated the syllables at the endsssss of eaccchhh worrdddd.",movies,1606609118,zeoplex,True,1,27,2020-11-28

Spontaneous (2020) is a unique and surprisingly touching teen movie,"Before I say anything else, please don't watch the trailer! It ruins a lot of otherwise nice surprises the movie has in store. 

Summary: Mara (Katherine Langford) is in her senior year of high school when something begins happening to her classmates; they randomly explode, leaving nothing but blood where a person once was. Spurred on by the fact that this fate might catch up with her at any moment, she starts a romance with her sweet-natured classmate, Dylan (Charlie Plummer). 

This film runs the gamut between a bunch of different genres, from romance, dark comedy, horror, and drama. I think it nails the tonal shifts really well and hits surprisingly hard (I was blinking back tears multiple times).

Some people have theorized that the plot is a metaphor for school shootings, but I consider it to be much broader than that--that at any moment, you or a loved one can die unexpectedly. It isn't right and it isn't fair, but the survivors have to find something to keep living for before they too are gone. 

I think this is near the peak of the teen movie genre due to how complex the themes are, and it's not afraid to get dark. I really recommend this film!",movies,1606610053,OpiumTraitor,True,1,21,2020-11-28

The small cast kept the focus tight, the plot moved along at a good pace, and the effects were, IMO, very well done (although oddly, it was some of the 'small' things that they fucked up; Illyana's crayons rolling back and forth when the perspective in that shot switches to over-the-shoulder was obviously bad).

Léon: The Professional or Léon: The Pedophile?,"I just saw this movie again after several year, and I noticed something weird I didn’t thought of the first time.

Matilda keeps on trying to get Leon to love her, she tries to kiss him, tells people that he’s her “lover” and later on she wants him to fck her. Yeah, she’s probably a bit messed up in the head after witnessing her whole family being brutality killed, including her 4 years old brother, plus she’s in the middle of her sexual awakening. But what’s creepy af here is the fact that Leon’s reason for not wanting to fck her isn’t that she’s just a 12 year old child, but because he “wouldn’t be a good lover” due to some broken heart sob story from his past. Fcking a kid doesn’t seem to be an issue for him though. What’s up with that? 

Then the scene where she almost blows her brains out to test his love, Leon leaves and have a private moment in the hallway to catch his breath because of his overwhelming emotions. Is it because she almost died just then, or is it his pedo feelings?

I don’t know, but something strange going on here! That is for sure. I really like this movie, it’s a great movie, but now I having a hard time seeing him as that great guy hero who took care of that poor girl after what she went through, now he’s more of a creepy pedophile who takes care of a poor girl, but doesn’t have sex with her because that sob story.

This film has a great premise and an all star cast, even if they weren't the bees knees at the time. 
Cap America himself is excellent in this, arguably the most sensible of the group, you almost wish they'd listened to him. 
But how could you against Cillian Murphy's Kappa? The calm and collected physicist, innocently logical and basing decisions on the same foundations of the entire mission. Science. 

I know there's a wide hate for the latter third of this film but I think this is really where it shines (no pun intended). Turning a technical science fiction journey into a momentary horror is brilliant. As if there wasn't enough pressure already. 

I dare anyone to say that the computer acknowledging an unknown crew member is not a great bit of horror in an otherwise horror-less film and to me this is not a downfall. 

In the first ten minutes this film makes you realise just how immensely powerful the sun is and from there shows you just how crazy people can get in the presence of something greater than themselves. 

This is just rum filled ramblings but good God I'm having a great time watching this film.",movies,1606616743,jacko1510,True,1,37,2020-11-28

"Klaus, the must watch Christmas movie for everybody","With Thanksgiving brushed off and just a few days away from December, my girlfriend and I have started our quarantine Christmas movie marathons and we got the chance to watch this masterpiece. I heard very little about it, but it's now my favorite Christmas movie of all time with stunning animations, a beautiful score, heart warming plot, and a great message. 

Although predictable at times, it's a unique Christmas orgin story that explores the elements of the holidays, and it does so in a way that's light hearted and innocent, but has its deep and memorable moments. It follows a protagonist, Jesper, that starts off as a spoiled brat that eventually comes to warm your heart through his actions and relationships. I loved all the characters and the town that we explore with the Jesper. 

It definitely is full of feels good moments and humor that I can't get enough of. I highly recommend it for basically anybody, and it's a real treat as we look forward to the holidays.",movies,1606617181,murimin,True,1,128,2020-11-28

Are there any films out there that focus on animal abusers?,"Are there any films out there that focus on animal abusers?

I don’t think I can think of one tbh. I can name hundreds of movies where the main goal of that film is to stop a serial killer, a rapist or a child killer, but none about animal abusers. All that comes to mind is Under the Silver Lake and Plague Dogs. 

It just seems to be something that exists exclusively in documentaries. One infamous example is “Don’t fuck with cats”. Other than that and the aforementioned other two movies that I mentioned at the top of my list, I honestly can’t really name a fictional movie that isn’t a documentary where an animal abuser is integral to the plot in the same way a serial killer plays an important role in a Criminal minds episode.",movies,1606618341,readingsteinerZ,True,1,18,2020-11-28
LaKeith Stanfield has had a wonderful run so far,"I actually first caught him in Short Term 12 and he was my favorite character in that movie which is funny since he turned out to now be one of my favorite actors. He’s been in so many of my favorite movies. Most notably, Sorry To Bother You which is one of my favorite films of all time. 

He always seems to be the same character when he acts but slightly different variations of that character. I loved him in Uncut Gems which is also one of my favorite films ever. That was a pleasant surprise and honestly probably my favorite act from him. Atlanta was super solid and I hope they make another season because he fit the role perfectly. Get Out was very very good as well, which makes him in 3 of my favorite films of all time. 

I look forward to this guys future roles and I wonder where he’ll be in say 5 years time acting wise. Super solid actor who seems to get a role in the best movies. He may seem ordinary or boring at first but I think there’s something different about him that really reels me in.",movies,1606618347,Weedsmoker4hunnid20,True,1,67,2020-11-28

Plot/story vs filmmaking technique etc. in determining the quality (specifically imdb rating) of a movie e.g. angels and demons,"angels and demons imdb rating is ~6.7 and fair enough a decent amount of the dialogue felt quite forced/stunted/unnatural/cheesy

despite this i really enjoyed the actual story, and as result the whole movie.

presumably the imdb rating would take into account a whole bunch of technical stuff (or maybe it doesnt? please correct me if im wrong) but i just felt the rating was quite low for a story that i enjoyed so much - even if certain aspects felt a bit weird

this is especially so when compared to say avengers endgame where the overall story was quite predictable/generic (nothing really amazing in that movie) but the imdb rating is so high. it seems to be a trend that the story aspect of more recent films is quite severely lacking - or is it just me?

"Is Melissa McCarthy done? 'Superintelligence' has released to absent marketing and abysmal scores, but on paper this is no ordinary misfire.","Those of you who remember *The Happytime Murders* might not be shocked to see a Melissa McCarthy comedy fizzle, but *Superintelligence* was a sure Hollywood bet on paper that exists in a different category altogether.

McCarthy's husband was a producer on Happytime Murders, but each of the films he directed himself have been box office hits she starred in. *Tammy*, *The Boss*, and *Life of the Party* were no critical darlings, but were received well enough that each made a substantial profit on modest budgets.

In contrast to R rated puppets, which confused her broad audience appeal, *Superintelligence* was long ago framed as a comedy in which a smart house A.I. system goes rogue on her, conjuring images in the mind of McCarthy shouting loudly into empty space. That's pretty much her wheelhouse.

This movie was directed by her 3-for-3 husband behind the camera, but this one was dropped on streaming today as if it didn't exist. In recent months, I encountered zero articles announcing that it would skip theaters due to COVID, never came across the movie trailer, and didn't see a single advertisement anywhere. The only reason I know this movie even exists is because of box office fantasy betting, which finally updated to reflect it was a released film.

The scores on *Superintelligence* are much lower than her movies by the same director, and her next flick, in post-production, is an overweight superhero parody coming on the heels of a lot of discussion about bodyweight and COVID risk. Even if people were to return to theaters next year, I can't imagine they'd look at material like that the same way.

So is that it? Do we close the book on Melissa McCarthy, or was her Oscar push and viral SNL sketch last year enough to give her a second life?",movies,1606432984,hombregato,True,1,25,2020-11-26

From IMDB: ""The lies, betrayal, and desires of nine different groups of people are revealed as they live out their secret lives in the sight of the security cameras that capture our every movement."" 

https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810951/

It's a series of vignettes showing a convenience store worker, two criminals on the road, a high school student trying to sleep with her teacher, a closeted lawyer who is a loving husband, and perhaps the most compelling story, a ruthlessly bullied nerd (in his office). You see how they engage the world around them, how the audience reacts - especially as it comes to sexuality. The ""gimmick"" of having it all captured on camera really added something when I first watched it - all of it feels that much more intimate and taboo, even though it's scripted. IT feels that much closer to real life. 

It's equal parts goofy, heart-rending, disturbing, and compelling, and all the actors were phenomenal. 

Showtime ran a series...for one measly season. I can see why something like that wouldn't have survived, but the movie really did leave me wanting more. 

I won't spoil it, but crime stories are obviously part of this film...and one of them is extremely disturbing. You see nothing, and that's the point. There's no real closure.

I think it'd be very interesting to get a movie that utilizes the dreamscape in ways we didn't see in Inception. The possibilities would be endless, considering reality is no longer the main focus.

Happiest Season reviews?,"I’m honestly so confused how this movie was received so positively. 

My wife and I watched this movie just because it seemed like a fun holiday movie for after Thanksgiving dinner. I like Mackenzie Davis, Daniel Levy, and Aubrey Plaza so I thought it would be good just because of the cast if nothing else.

Holy hell that movie was just awful though. So many cliches and unlikeable characters that it made for quite a difficult watch. My wife (who was the one who wanted to watch it) after 45 minutes said “ok this is bad right?” I think she was trying to gauge my reaction...but I agreed wholeheartedly. 

Anyway, I don’t want to review the movie, but I do have to ask: how did this movie get so many positive reviews? It currently holds an 86 on RT and I’m bewildered by that. Is this a case of the movie being reviewed positively because of the subject matter? I’m 100 percent on board with gay/lesbian movies but are reviewers scared to give that content negative reviews for fear of being ostracized?

GOOD or BAD: Alien vs. Predator (2004),"Whether it be on film, TV, or in a comic book, who doesn't love a good crossover? As a kid, I sat in awe playing Kingdom Hearts and visiting various Disney worlds and marveled at seeing my the Jimmy/Timmy Power Hour on Nickelodeon (who remembers that?). Needless, to say, crossovers can be fun if done right. Take Freddy vs. Jason. Who doesn't want to see Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees beat the crap out of each other? With that said, let's talk about the crossover that should have been amazing, [Alien vs. Predator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cld40qD7HcY). 

First off, why is this movie, the product of two R-rated franchises, rated PG-13? Everything just feels so neutered because of it. It's like making a Mortal Kombat movie PG-13 (oh wait that did happen). Even still, AVP has a weak filmmaker at the helm with Paul W.S. Anderson. Now I know a lot of people may like his movies in same way people like Stephen Sommers movies (The Mummy, Van Helsing, etc.) but when you consider the directors that came before, this was just disappointing. 

Here are the filmmakers that came before:

* Alien (1979) - Ridley Scott \[Blade Runner, Gladiator, Kingdom of Heaven\]
* Aliens (1986) - James Cameron \[The Terminator, True Lies, Titanic\]
* Predator (1987) - John McTiernan \[Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October\]
* Predator (1990) - Stephen Hopkins \[Okay this guy doesn't have the best filmography\]
* Alien^(3)  (1992) - David Fincher \[Se7en, Fight Club, The Social Network\]
* Alien: Resurrection (1997) - Jean-Pierre Jeunet \[Amélie\]

I've watched Casino.,"The reason why I watched clips of Martin Scorsese's 1995 Las Vegas crime drama epic is me scrolling down the Bowdlerise Film page on TV Tropes, which had a section about the hilarious censorship of the movie, and I watched clips of it on YouTube. I only watch this mob movie because it has Joe Pesci, one of my favorite actors growing up when I saw him in *Home Alone*. As for my honest opinion on this film, while it doesn't break new ground in cinema, it's still fairly serviceable in terms of acting, cinematography, soundtrack, and the Las Vegas setting, which are pretty good. Not as good as, say, *Goodfellas*, but still fine on its merits.

The movie's best parts are when Ace Rothstein throws out a cowboy who put his feet on the table at the Tangiers Casino, Nicky Santoro putting Tony Doggs' head in a vise, Ginger McGee going berserk, and the meeting in the desert. The one thing I would complain about is the excessive profanity. Look, I know mobsters don't always have the cleanest mouths out there, but jeez, do they have to use nearly every swear word in the book to convey to us that it's a gritty mob drama? Others like it don't always rely on this gimmick 100% of the time, and we still get what they're trying to tell us. I'm not again swearing in movies. In fact, I tolerate most of the time with the exceptions of the F-word, the C-word, the C-sucker word, and the T-word, the former three of which are uttered in *Casino* sometimes gratuitously. I do find Pesci's usage of the F-word to be funny at times in specific scenes. Overall, I would rate a 6-7 out of 10 or 3 and a half stars.",movies,1606451064,Ficboy,True,1,25,2020-11-26

Flaw In Syndrome's Plan From The Incredibles,"So in the movie Incredibles (2004) we had Syndrome's plan of defeating the omnidroid and gaining the favor of the entire city as its new superhero protector. That's all well and good, but if Syndrome was actually able to pull off his plan successfully, what did he really expect to happen? Superheroes by that point were still very much illegal. As we saw after the Parr family + Frozone defeat the Omnidroid that was still wasn't enough to make superheros legal again in Incredibles 2. So even if he did defeat the Omnidroid Syndrome still wouldn't be able to continue to practice his superhero duties or else he'd be in trouble by the law. 

Did Syndrome actually have a plan to make superheroes legal again in the long run? Would he have been spotted by Winston Deavor instead and asked to work with him towards enacting the plan of returning the legality of superheroes again? Would Syndrome end up killing all the new superheroes that were seen in Incredibles 2 in order to hog all of the attention to himself?

The one problematic factor would be that Syndrome would lose access to most of his assets as seen in the end of Incredibles 1 when Dicker stated it as much. It seemed to me that the government found out all about Syndrome's base on Nomanisan shortly after the Omnidroid arrived in the city - probably from Mirage snitching as soon as she freed the Parr family. So it really boggles the mind as to how Syndrome had planned to make superheroes legal again if he no longer would have the resources to keep building more omnidroids to keep impressing the public with.",movies,1606454510,ShigaHockey,True,1,5,2020-11-26

"""Movies about making movies"" is the worst film genre","I've noticed that a lot of authors have a tendency to make their protagonist extremely interested in books, because (shocker) the author themself is extremely interested in books and they are just projecting themselves onto the character. Similarly, some  writers and directors (especially in Rom Coms) have a tendency to make every movie take place in LA, make their characters aspiring film makers or some sort of person involved in the industry. You also have a whole group of movies that are essentially movies about making movies (e.g. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Hail Caesar!, etc) 

Here's the problem with these movies: very few people actually give AF about the process of filmmaking....most people are only interested in the final product. Filmmakers and filmmaking just aren't that interesting unless that is your specific passion in life.  On top of that, a lot of these movies just come off as being a bit out of touch, almost like they were made by people in the Hollywood celebrity bubble who think their lives are way more interesting than they actually are. 

A good example of the shortcomings of this genre would be Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. The movie had plenty going for it, with some interesting sub-plots going on in the background, and some funny and entertaining characters....but I noticed all the best parts of this movie are the parts where he is bringing in other genres - horror, comedy, action. When the movie gets back to its base of being a movie about making movies is when it starts dragging on and becoming this boring self indulgent docu-drama about old Hollywood. If this movie would have just focused on the Manson family story it probably would have been one of Tarantino's best movies, because those scenes in particular were great....however all of that got diluted under boring ""film about filmmaking"" scenes and endless cameos and references to 1960s pop culture.",movies,1606455902,Ornery_Captain,True,1,17,2020-11-26

In Knives Out (2019) why didn’t Ransom realize that Marta didn’t poison Harlan once he found out about the slit throat?,"I can’t find an answer for this online. 

Ransom’s plan was very simple: switch the labels on the vials so that Marta would accidentally give Harlan 100mg of morphine without realizing. Then Harlan would simply die in his sleep, a toxicology screening would be performed, and Marta would be arrested thus handing Harlan’s fortune back to his family. 

Instead, she accidentally gives Harlan the correct medicine but believes she’s given him morphine because of the label, and Harlan slits his own throat to make it look like suicide. 

It’s revealed in Benoit’s monologue at the end that Ransom only realized Marta didn’t poison Harlan when Marta and Ransom spoke at the bar. He then decided to burn down the building with the toxicology report in it to destroy evidence of her innocence (ie that there was no poisoning).  

But wouldn’t he have realized she didn’t poison Harlan the instant he heard that Harlan’s throat was slit? Why would Harlan’s throat be slit in Ransom’s plan?",movies,1606457606,glee-clubber,True,1,4,2020-11-26

Any good break downs of da 5 bloods/spike lee?,"I just finished Da 5 Bloods, and I regret to say I really didn't understand it. It feels like whatever emotional/thematic significance it held went right over my head. I didn't feel much attachment to the characters, the odd editing and documentary-esque style of filming lost me and misdirected me, it felt like there was always some sort of tonal dissonance between the performances or the writing or the scene or the music. It felt like people just died for no reason, characters turned on eachother out of nowhere, it felt like things just happened to happen, I felt no engagement with the plot because it didn't feel like there was any rhyme or reason to anything. Stylistically it was very cool, and many scenes were entertaining to watch simply because the style was so non-traditional, but most of the time it just felt like a badly cut documentary. 

I understood the more hamfisted morals/themes revolving around black people in the vietnam war, the injustice and division wrought on by the war and all the events following it, but it didn't really feel like that had much to do with the characters and their emotional journeys. Most of them died before we could ever see a conclusion to those journeys anyways. I think the most apparent was in paul's journey, his character arc was the most obvious, but his intentions in the story still felt like they came out of nowhere. And even when we learn he killed Chadwick Boseman's character by mistake, I feel like I'm so far deep into this weird psychosis revenge plot that it doesn't seem to prove how he'd ever feasibly arrive at the conclusion that he should abandon and hate his son and his friends for money. It feels like the only other explanation for that is to just say ""well he has ptsd"" which would be interesting, but they don't explore that at all. This applies to so many places in the film, it feels like there are things I'm supposed to know about these characters and their journey that I clearly missed. 

But nonetheless, this film got rave reviews. And I do believe that it's objectively good. I think the style was interesting, some of the performances were fantastic in particular moments, and what thematic significance I could plant was relatively impactful. It just felt so haphazard because I don't think I was really latching onto what I should have, and I likely missed the real significance of many moments, which made it end up feeling flat and like a failed experiment. 

So I'd love if anyone had a good video or article they could link me to. 
I've not seen any other Spike Lee joints than Black Klansman so maybe I'm just not educated enough on his style to know what I should pay attention to. Or, perhaps, do more people share my sentiment and I'm not so alone in thinking this movie is very discombobulated? I'd love to understand why people loved this movie so much, and I'd like to educate myself in general on Lee's style. Thanks guys, I look forward to your responses.",movies,1606086672,MaxKCoolio,True,1,11,2020-11-22

Why Madagascar 2 is a perfect movie.,"I just watched Madagascar 2 and I would like to share my opinion on why Madagascar 2 is the perfect movie (go easy on me please, amateur here).

Madagascar 2 has a similar premise to it's prequel, the protagonists get stranded in an unknown location and they have to adapt to it while also trying to solve their insecurities, but the second movie takes the premise and just annihilates it.

The movie begins with the introduction of Alex's father, Zuba, and baby Alex back in the savannah. From this we learn how he got to New York in the first place. Hunters lured him away while his father was fighting, after the fight, Zuba realised what had happened and started chasing down after the hunters who had kidnapped Alex. After getting shot in the ear by the hunters, Zuba falls of their truck and Alex falls of it into the river, and after Zuba comes to his senses again, he starts chasing the truck again,thinking that Alex is there, but Alex was in the river at this point and he had no idea. This entire sequence shows us the love of a parent toward their child, the dedication, strength and will of a parent when their child is in danger, the unbreakable bond between a parent and a child. This sequence truly is amazing, and luckily it isn't the only one.

Then the movie cuts to the present where our protagonists (Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria and the penguins) are getting ready to go home to New York on a plane that they had rebuilt, but as they're getting in, King Julian joins them and they have to accept it, beacuse he's the self proclaimed king.Once they're on the plane they finally start to fly, in charge of the plane are, of course, the penguins.

About a good like hour maybe less on their flight, the plane starts crashing and it lands in a savannah, but not any savannah, they land in the savannah where Alex is actually from, as shown in that opening sequence. At first the crew don't really seem to be welcome to the savannah, but when Zuba discovers that that's actually Alex, he becomes extatic, beacuse he thought that his child had been killed by those hunters. The happiness and joy in Zuba's eyes in that moment are indescribable, the reunion of a child with their long lost parent is the most beautiful thing in the world.

As the gang get accepted by everyone in their individual groups, they love it at first, but come to learn that it ain't that great, much like how a kid feels after starting school. 

Alex is the first one to find this out. When Alex was doing the ritual thing where he has to fight one of his peers, the villain, Makunga tells him to pick the buffest, toughest, biggest lion he possibly could, so that he could become the Alpha and lead the savannah. This works since Alex can't fight, plus he thought it was a dance competition. Alex gets his ass handed to himself, and his father, the current Alpha, has to banish him from the savannah, but instead of doing that, he resides as Alpha and Makunga takes the spot and banishes Alex and his family. Now, through this entire thing, there was a huge misunderstanding between Alex and his father. Zuba thought that he was a king, which Alex was, he was the king of New York, and instead of fighting, he danced and the people cheered. This is where we realise Alex's insecurity: not being good enough to the person you look up to the most, in this case, your father. Not getting any encouragement and love from the people that you love, just beacuse they don't like what you do. This is one of the things that mostly teens have to deal with, and the movie handles it perfectly.

Now for Marty: When Marty first meets the other zebras, he finds out they're exactly like him. They way they talk, act, think, it's all the same. And at first, Marty loves this, but then later on when he's teaching the other zebras his zoo act, that he took forever to learn, he sees that every single zebra did it perfectly on their first try. This is when Marty realises that he isn't special and that others, just like him, can do it too. This is another problem teens have to deal with, the fear of being a mute, a no-one, just the average joe for the rest of their life. And Marty's problem gets resolved by Alex when he's looking for him in a see of zebras that all look the same, Alex successfully points Marty out. Why? Beacuse Alex knows Marty as a true friend, he teaches us that the outside doesn't matter, what matters is the inside, your personality, AKA : the real YOU!

And now it's Gloria's turn! Gloria has kind of a boring story here, but whatever it's amazing anyways. So basically Gloria finds a guy, which is a thing she wanted, but then learns that he's only into her because, and I quote: ""she's big, she's chunky and she's plumpy"". This message is kind of for girls only, but I found that it has 2 meanings. The first meaning is that you shouldn't stay with someone, or be with someone that sees you and treats you like an object. This is a beautiful message that's 110% true. The second meaning is actually the fear of a lot of people that they will never find their true love, since the hottest guy is into Gloria but she sees that he sees her as an object, but then Melman interferes and tells Moto Moto that if he was lucky as him that he would buy Gloria flowers every single day, that he would get her a bed and breakfast every single day and that he would cherish her for what an amazing personality she has, not her body. Speaking of, now it's time for Melman.

Melman's story is the most relatable one by far. He starts his carrer by getting the doctor title since he learns that there aren't any doctors there, and no one is better qualified than him. After having fun with being a doctor he hears that Gloria has a date (btw he's in love with Gloria) with the strong, big, plumpy, chunky Moto Moto. After hearing this he becomes really sad, which is understandable, since he has a crush on Gloria, he's sad and we sympathize. After King Julian gives him the advice of just being honest and telling her how he feels, he does just that and he gets the girl in the end. Melman's fear was that he will never find love, at all. This is something that a lot of people experience, including myself. The message of just doing it, and being brave, is the best message they could have gave us.

In the end everyone is redeemed; Alex saves his father and himself from being eaten by doing what he knows best - dancing, and his father finally accepts that his son maybe wasn't made to be a fierce, strong lion and that his passion was hiding somewhere else. Marty realises that he is special in his own way, just like everyone. Gloria dumps Moto Moto and sees that guys like Melman are the real deal, and Melman gets the courage to confess his love, which works out perfectly.

The penguins and King Julian were here for comedic effect, so nothing much to say there.

Overall, Madagascar 2 is the perfect movie and gets a 5+/5. Thanks for reading.",movies,1606093503,Vule777,True,1,6,2020-11-22

Movie where a finger is cut off?," 

I am 90% sure this is either a comedy movie or a parody of an action movie. I only remember one scene.

There's a man, the villain, asleep on a couch (possibly dead.) The protagonists have to get through a door locked with fingerprint access. The cut off the guy's finger. I think at some point later on (maybe a few scenes later,) they realize that the finger they cut off was either the villain's twin brother or a body double. I think the protagonists are at least one man and one woman, there's at least one woman that's a major character in the movie because I remember being attracted to her as a kid. I think they cut off his thumb, but I'm not sure.

Observational and expository mode docos about alternative subcultures?,"Sorry for weird question, but I'm doing some research leading up to making a doco for my university degree. As part of this I have to write a paper on the different documentary modes and their pros and cons. The doco I hope to make will be a short look into the lives of modern Pagan witches as I recently met some wonderful people who are happy to appear and explain their beliefs in a film. I have kind of already decided that a participatory doco would be the best way to go about it but I need to back this up with some examples and counter examples.

**Anyone know any observation or expository mode films (the Bill Nichol categorization system) I can watch about alternative subcultures or ways of living?** Short or long is fine. I've covered most of the other modes already in my paper and am looking for some different things, and am happy to be proven wrong by a really good one.

Some films I've watched so far: Paris is Burning, The Most Hated Family in America, The Truffle Hunters, My Scientology Movie, Jesus Camp, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM7Vsm4Gm54) etc.

These have been great but mostly fall into the performative/ participatory mode. Hoping that the extensive movie knowledge of you lot can help me out.

For those who may not be aware of the terminology, these definitions are from the masterclass website:

**Observational documentary** is a type of documentary filmmaking that aims to record realistic, everyday life without intrusion. Also called cinéma vérité style, direct cinema, or fly-on-the-wall filmmaking.

**Expository documentarie**s set up a specific point of view or argument about a subject and a narrator often speaks directly to the viewer, emphasizing the relationship between the images presented on-screen and offering verbal commentary. Expository documentaries [include footage that supports and strengthens the spoken argument of the film](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/filmmaker-ken-burnss-top-tips-for-documentary-cinematography), including stock footage, archival footage, b-roll, or re-enactments of historical events.

Often times cinema lovers don’t have a favourite film of all time but have one for each year blahblahblah. Not me... no, I do indeed have an all time favourite film and it is...... SICARIO!!!

The film IMO is an absolute masterpiece and is the benchmark to which I think all true artistic pictures should be made. Anyway staight to brass-tacks.

Upon discovering the bodies at the start in the house of horrors, if you look very closely (and have a particularly grizzley imagination) you can see that there fecaes in the bags that the victims have been suffocated with. So the assumption is the cartel members defacted in a bag and then suffocated the victims with said bags (disgusting I know, but we are all too aware that cartels are not below these sorts of shock tactics to deter “rats” and to ‘one up’ opposing gang members).

Anyway my detail (theory... but pretty damn solid theory) is that when we are first introduced to Silvio (the crooked federale), the first shot we see is a close up of his hand and you can quite clearly see a brown smudge on his thumb which can only be one thing... fecaes. This very, very subtle clue tells us that Silvio is working for the cartel and has even perpetrated one of the most hideous acts in the whole film!!! This is why I’ve hated Silvio from the moment I watched the film. 

The only thing is... I have never... ever, ever, ever seen anything written about this on the internet. BUT! I’m sure people will agree with me when they come back round to it!!! Haha please do let me know what you think and let me know your fave film ever is. I hopee you liked the read guys.

TLDR; It’s hinted in a single shot that bent cop Silvio was involved in the murders at the beggining of the film.",movies,1606097111,PringleWallet,True,1,5,2020-11-22

Movies are like mildly dirty bathtubs.,"*Disclaimer: I’m probably not the person to ask for examples as I am not an experienced film analyst. Understand my point but take my examples with a grain of salt.*

Say you see a bathtub that’s dirty. Nothing extreme, just mildly dirty. Your job is to make it interesting. The dirty bathtub represents a plain, generic movie with no heart or soul put into it. There’s two ways to make the bathtub interesting: clean the bathtub, or make it dirty. 

Knives Out is an example of a movie that would “clean the bathtub.” It’s an articulate and tight-knit movie that has multiple interesting aspects, from the story, to the characters, and, of course, to the mystery. Knives Out would scrub the bathtub for an hour after every bath. 

The Room is a movie that would “make the bathtub dirty.” It’s such a messy movie with idiotic dialogue and a nonsensical story. But people love this movie. Why? Because it’s interesting. The Room would pee in and shit on the bathtub so much it would have to be evicted for neglect.

The main issue lies with forgettable movies: those that take the dirty bathtub and say, “Leave it be.” These movies can vary, but I most often like to use action movies like the newer Mission Impossibles and the Taken movies as examples. Those that the Hollywood machine cranks out mindlessly. 

So, in short, ~~shit in bathtubs~~ the best movies are the most interesting",movies,1606099650,NeonSprig,True,1,2,2020-11-22

Al Pacino is fantastic in Serpico,"Fresh off The Godfather, Al Pacino has the starring role as Frank Serpico. It’s the true story of an honest cop in NYC during the 60s-70s who refuses to take bribes when everyone else around him is. You truly feel for the man as he came in idealistic and wanting to make a difference, but when you see all your colleagues and partners taking bribes and kickbacks it can be tough to stay clean. The explosiveness and charisma that Pacino brings may be no surprise to those that follow his work, but Pacino is a fresh face on the scene in ‘73. He had just done a performance of a lifetime as a calm and calculating Michael Corleone in one of (if not) the greatest films of all time. This was a tremendous follow up as Serpico goes through such a swing of emotions and I love the one man against the world theme (in classic New York no less).

Movie trope I don't see mentioned often.,"I may be wrong but whenever the conversation of movie tropes comes up I don't see this one mentioned despite it happening a lot.

But memory be damned I can't think of a specific scene or movie where it happens.

Here is one variation of this trope but there are many which follow a similar structure.

So guy A does some shit that will get him in trouble, guy B walks in and catches him and says ""guy A! What are you doing?!"" 

Then guy A is about to explain when both guy A and guy B hear THE BOSS walking their way. They both panic and guy A is like ""Cover me I'll explain later. Please."" When the boss gets there he suspects something and asks guy A, ""what is going on here?"" 

Now this is the part I consider a trope that bothers me.

Guy B stares at guy A and Guy A stares back with an expression that may as well scream ""please don't say anything!"" And then after such a long pause and stare down guy B finally says to the boss ""no sir nothing out of the ordinary."" And then the Boss just buys it and goes away.

Why doesn't the boss ever say ""why did it take you so long to answer? And why the fuck are you two staring at each other? And why does guy A look like he's about to cry?""

But nope, we just have to believe that the boss doesn't notice anything fishy about the whole ordeal.


Anyways is this a trope? I'm not sure but I feel like it is, I see it all the time.",movies,1606100726,bacb,True,1,17,2020-11-22

I finally got round to watching Venom... Why did the critics pan this thing?,"After over 2 years, I finally sat down and watched Venom (it dropped on Netflix UK recently). I hadn't watched it before because with that roughly 30% critic rating, I felt it probably wasn't worth watching, or that it was only gonna be okay at best.

Is it great? No.

Is it anywhere near as bad as critics seem to think it is? Hell no.

I thought it was a good little movie. Kinda like Solo: A Star Wars Story. Both are what I would call (in the great words of Jeremy Jahns), a great time, no alcohol required.

Let's face it, both of these movies aren't breaking any new ground, however I don't know if they were ever really intended to be. Now, (correct me if in wrong) I do believe Venom was supposed to be a more horror based movie than other superhero things we'd seen before (?), but having watched the movie, that's clearly not the tone they were actually going with.

I thought what we ended up with was pretty fun though. Maybe it was just my relatively dark sense of humour, but I found a lot of scenes in this very funny, and in a much different way to the usual quipping/slapstick that you normally get in comic book (MCU) movies. I thought the chemistry between Eddie/Venom was pretty well done (although I found a couple of their motivations were pretty questionable). 

A lot of people mention that the lack of Spiderman really hurt this film, although I don't know where he would have really fit into this particular story. He certainly didn't *need* to be there at any rate.

The plot is pretty basic, and the villain gives the lower tier MCU villains a run for their money, but at the end of the day, it was funny, well acted (by Tom Hardy at least), and the action was pretty slick/unique. There's not much more that I really wanted from this sort of film. 
Maybe its just about expectations. I didn't go in expecting anything really, so maybe that just worked in its favour. I don't think this movie deserves some of the vitriol that some reviewers have given it though.",movies,1606101324,_DeanRiding,True,1,16,2020-11-22

"What movie did you dislike after you had watched it, but after some realizations, you found out that you actually like it?","Note: English is not my first language so please bear with my grammar.

“Realizations” in this question doesn’t mean it has to be “rewatching”, sum thinking is enough.

Mine is Midsommar and Ladybird (i know lots of you will say that they’re overrated). I found Midsommar too slow, my attention span says so, and Ladybird senseless and meaningless. 

After a few hours, I realized that if ever I was the main character in Midsommar, I’d probably cry all day in that place cus I don’t like the feeling of being jailed. When I was watching Lady Bird, I observed that I was just waiting for it to end but after watching it, I felt like I was just watching myself since I found many scenes relatable.

Predestination,"I have a few problems with this movie.

Jane at one time HAD to have two parents. I’m even willing to bring in the idea of a third party of your choice but, I digress. 

Even after filling that HUGE gap of initial birth. I refuse to believe that John as a grown man would lack the conscious to flee NY after killing the Fizzler.

Jane was intellectual growing up. An intellectual would stop the feedback loop by not doing the initial jump. I’ll explain. 

There’s a bunch of time that isn’t accounted for. When Hawke is bartender he’s already aged and has previous knowledge of the time travels and how bad they went. Instead of pretending he doesn’t know this person, he literally suggests that his younger self go back in time to impregnate his EVEN younger self. I just can’t seem to grasp what he would gain from knowingly doing this.

There’s a chance John/Jane did this on purpose to spawn an infinite life?

Also, when the Fizzler shows future news clips; how did he do this with a decommissioned device? Did I miss something? 

The movie was fun and gave me 15 min of confusion but nothing much more.

TLDR: In the Mood for Love is a master piece; R:1,"I rarely watch this film, choosing to savor it instead of being gluttonous.

 Its a film that can have an extreme emotional impact. Unlike mainstream films it doesn't evoke sadness, or joy. Not anger, or pity, or wonder. 

In me, it evokes longing. 

The same longing from thinking about the past. The same longing of wondering what could have been. Ultimately, it connects me with a me who exists beneath the surface. Someone who my callous,  work focused self doesn't recognize. The me who longs for a connection that isn't there, one seemingly out of reach. 

As I said before, I choose to savor this film. I watched it for the first time about 3 years ago, and have only watched it about that many times. It reminds me that there is an aspect of my life unattended. And even if I don't consciously feel it, the desire and need for it to be fulfilled is still there. It allows for introspection, and reinvigorates me to change my situation. 

If you haven't watched this film, I implore you too. Don't read summaries or synopses. Find a time when you are alone and its quiet and just watch. Then give yourself time to process.

Thank you for reading my post, I hope you have a wonderful day.",movies,1606105169,sadcollegekd,True,1,4,2020-11-22

For me, the most recent one was ""Train to Busan"". Yes, a zombie movie. 

Nobody expects to cry in a zombie movie unless you really have a thing for not watching blood and am forced by friends to watch a zombie flick together.

The movie had so many settings to mess with your emotions. The father and daughter relationship, the pregnant lady and the soon to be dad relationship, highschool teen lovers, and even a granny granny relationship.

"Looking for a war movie I watched when I was younger,","Hey Movie enthusiasts, I'm looking for a movie about the Iraq / Afghanistan / Middle Eastern war. In the movie, a US Army (or Marine) convoy is ambushed on a bridge after a suspicious vehicle/object is blocking the road. They fight back, but with a lot of their vehicles destroyed and many wounded, they decide to regroup at a local Police station. At the Police station, they throw one of their wounded on a table and look around. They find one of the Police Officers on his phone (presumably contacting terrorist/local militias) and just when their about to detain him the Police station gets attacked. That's all I remember for the most part. The parts I've described stop at the midpoint of the movie. If you can find this, please do!

K-19 (2002),"So to night I decided to put on K-19, a movie about a soviet nuclear submarine with Harrison Ford and Liam Nesson, two actors I really like and appreciate. And I must had to this that I've also started re-watching Tschernobyl the serie from HBO about a week ago. And They are pretty complementary.

Anyway, it's a great movie. The tention and this feeling of isolation are really well transmitted. The image is really well worked, as well as the sound design, and the music. I reamly encourage you to see it, but maybe not if you're not feeling that well. It's not especially hard, but you still have to old down to your stomach if you are easily moved ans touch by movies. I must say, that I didn't feel great after watching it. But it's reamly good movie, based on true events. Plus it's been directed by Kathryn Bigelow (A woman), and not that this makes it any better, but I just rarely see movies directed by woman, and it's intresting to see that their are no difference with a man. So yep, on down from my list.

I haven't made any post lately despite that fact that I've seen quite a lot of movies in the past two weeks, so I'll do short posts like these in tha'e days to come!",movies,1605745554,Dr_Peter_Venkman_84,True,1,6,2020-11-18

"Spider-Man (2002) has 34,297,354 user ratings on Rotten Tomatoes.","Seen some headlines regarding set photos of the upcoming Spider-man movie, the third in the most recent trilogy, and I started to think about the original trilogy from the early 2000's. I've always considered them to be good movies for the most part, so I was interested in how general audiences view them. So I went to Rottentomatoes for some insight, and started with the original film..

And then I seen the amount of user submitted scores. **34,297,354 with an average score of 3.3 out of 5. (67%)**

***So I have two questions for the sub:***

***1:*** Is this the most scored film, quantity-wise, out of any movie on that site? I've tried to google for some results, and all that seems to pop up, are results like ""Highest rated movies of all time"" and whatnot, regarding overall scores.

Just my opinion on the Movie “the mule” [spoilers?],I fucking loved it from the story to the characters. It felt like the movie got more sad yet it was able to keep the movie going and not get stuck at one moment. But there was one thing I disliked and that is it’s ending. I felt that it’s ending was very anticlimactic and rushed i understand that this is a Clint Eastwood movie but for the last parts of the movie we’re he starts to make up with his family just to pled guilty and completely destroy the whole reason for why he was making up with his children that reason being him spending time with his family.

With the news of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both having extremely high efficacy rates of 90%+ and having passed key stages of testing, I think this frames the film differently... here we are only 8 months after COVID hit the west, with very possible working vaccines.

Andrei Rublev: Apocalyptic Horses Theory (and Tarkovsky's personal explanation),"I was watching Andrei Rublev the other day and the horse scenes always confused me a little bit until I noticed that the horses are first introduced in a group of four and the last scene also features four horses, which immediately made me think of ""Oh, the four horsemen of the apocalypse"".

When watching it again, I noticed that the movie actually does follow the ""Four horsemen of the apocalypse"" idea to a degree. For example, right after the war, conflict, and plundering of the land, it is mentioned that they went through a great famine and now a plague. The order of the four horsemen of the apocalypse is usually identified as ""Victory/Conquest, War/Division, Famine, and then plague"", which is roughly the order of events as they occur in Andrei Rublev.

What also made me think that this was intentional is that the very end of the movie is literally a pull-out shot of Jesus' face, the sound of thunder is heard, and then we see four horses standing in the rain. In most traditional motifs, God's wrath and judgement is symbolized through the sound of thunder and great storms. I just found the juxtaposition of the imagery to be far more than a coincidence that we have a shot of Jesus along with the sound of thunder and then cutting to a shot of four horses, which are, interestingly enough, the correct colors of the four horse of the apocalypse.

White Horse: The horse on the far right

Red Horse: The horse behind the horse in the middle. If you color pick the shot, it has the most red hue out of all of the horses. Due to the shot being in the rain and all of the colors being shifted, it doesn't look bright red, but it appears that it's ""natural color"" is red/brown.

Black Horse: Horse on the far left

Pale/Sickly Horse: The horse in the center. This one is more of a gray color, but whenever it moves the light reflections look like that of a gray horse and not a dark horse.

The shot in question: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsEbrhv2jGY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsEbrhv2jGY)

Now, my interpretation of the colors could be wrong, but when color picking them it seems to workout.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, Tarkovsky's explanation is a bit different. It more deals with horses be close to nature and horses representing nature and life and that Tarkovsky took inspiration from life itself:

“I’d like to point out the film ends with an image of horses in the rain. It is a symbolic image as the horse for me is a synonym for life. When I’m looking at a horse, I have a feeling I’m in direct contact with the essence of life itself. Perhaps it’s because the horse is a very beautiful animal, friendly to man, and is moreover so characteristic of the Russian landscape. There are many scenes with horses in Rublev. Take the scene in which a man dies after an unsuccessful attempt to fly. A sad-looking horse is a silent witness to the scene. The presence of horses in the last, final scene means that life itself was the source of all of Rublev’s art.”

Source: [http://www.nostalghia.com/TheTopics/TarkovskyonRublev.html](http://www.nostalghia.com/TheTopics/TarkovskyonRublev.html)

What I find interesting about this is that Tarkovsky's explanation for the horses is vastly different than what visual tropes are used. If you were to show almost any Christian/Catholic a shot of Jesus, rain, thunder, and a White, Black, Red, and Pale horse they would all immediately say ""That's apocalyptic imagery that represents coming judgment from Jesus Christ."" I also find it very hard to imagine that Tarkovksy, as a man who seemed to have an understanding of East Orthodox traditions and was possibly a bit religious himself, would not recognize these tropes/religious motifs as well. For example, the first scene that shows rain following the protagonist seems to be the will of God since it starts and stops wherever they move, while in the background we see the silhouettes of four horsemen off in the distance. Again, I find it very hard to believe that Tarkovsky wouldn't have had some sort of knowledge of apocalyptic imagery when the visual imagery of ""four horses in the rain (that is seemingly controlled by God) with thunder in the background"" is used twice in the film.

Another example of religious motifs being used in the movie to represent the will of God would be when Andrei first encounters the pagans. As he is running into the woods, blindly, we see doves fly in behind him. Traditionally speaking, doves represent the Holy Spirit in Christianity and is what is considered to be the main driving force behind missionaries and people who go out to convert non-believers into Christians. I find it very hard to believe that it is just a ""nice coincidence"" that as Andrei is running in to investigate the pagans that we see doves flying in behind him. Now, I think the in-movie explanation is that the doves are from a pagan ritual or something (I forget if we see the pagans releasing doves or not) but the timing and composition of them flying in behind him as he enters the unknown had to be carefully planned by the director and crew so it is no accident that the imagery was produced.

What also bothers me a little bit is that Andrei's explanation doesn't really fit in with the narrative of Andrei Rublev's character. There are no instances where Andrei Rublev seems to really be attached to nature anymore than any of the other characters or artists. The only scene I can really think of is when he is in the woods and he sees a snake in the water. That's it. Andrei Rublev's main character arc more revolves around his struggles with suppressing his own talents and wanting to show the ""beauty of Christianity"" as opposed to showing the harsh judgment of the end times (as brought up when he changes the plans for the interior of the building he is painting) because he sees the fear that their works brings upon all the different people's throughout the movie (the skomorokh, the pagans, and many others). The movie is full of religious imagery, motifs, and symbolism, and for the horses (the final image of the film) to simply represent ""life"" seems like an understatement to a lot of the bigger ideas in the film.

To bounce off of that, in Christianity, there is a fairly wide variety of beliefs as to whether or not some of the events of tribulation have already occurred, along with different beliefs on ""premillennialism vs postmillennialism"". Some Christians do genuinely believe that the plague that wreaked havoc in Europe in the middle-ages was the metaphorical ""pale horse of the apocalypse"".

In conclusion, I find that the order of events in which things happen in Andrei Rublev fits the general flow of the ""four horsemen of the apocalypse"" narrative and was, hypothetically speaking, an intentional motif created by Tarkovsky, but for some reason or another he limited his explanation to what it was about to just be ""I think horses look cool"" possibly due to soviet tensions, censorship, or other such struggles which limited the complexity of his response. It is no secret that there was a lot of religious persecution in the USSR and the film Andrei Rublev was itself a product of censorship. Though Tarkovsky himself says he prefers the shortened version, I'm not sure if he really had a choice in the matter when you are talking about a USSR product (especially one of such scale and budget).

There is peace, then there is war, divisions, a famine is mentioned, a plague occurs (mentioned as killing off Boriska's family), and then the movie finishes with Andrei Rublev finally painting icons of Christ (a return of Christ) again with an image of four horses (of correctly corresponding colors) in the rain with the sound of thunder in the background. To me, that screams of intentional apocalyptic imagery, but I could be mistaken.

Possible plot hole in Looper that is bothering me,"I know, I know, movie like that that involves time travel is going to have plot holes galore.

But one that's really bother me involves Old Guy's wife. When Old Guy meets Young Guy in the diner, Young tells Old to show him a picture of his wife so he can avoid her in the future. Problem solved. Old refuses because he doesn't want to lose the memory of his wife.

But even seeing the picture is unnecessary. At that very moment Young could have just personally vowed to never get married and avoid relationships. The very fact that Old told him about his wife and his story would have doomed him if Young made that decision. That decision would have closed the ""loop"".

BUT if for some reason Young didn't want to take that step at that moment, he sure as hell could have done that in the field as he decides to kill himself. Instead of killing himself he could have, again, just vowed to never get married and stay away from any woman he feels attracted to.

So, me loving the first Godfather to pieces, watched the second film. I enjoyed it but afterwards I was just thinking to myself “That was good movie but just not better than the first.” I just love the first movie so much. I don’t know I guess it’s because of the allure of the original cast, Brando’s performance, the many quotable lines. I just love it to death.

2001 A Space Odyssey Discussion,"To preface this post, I personally think that this is an incredible film. However, this film raises many questions for me about the way we look at and judge films. Here they are:

1. Does a film raising philosophical questions really make it a great film?

2. Film is inherently a form of entertainment. Should we dock points for portions that seem far too long (ie the apes in 2001)?

3. Too what degree does plot complexity and even semi confusing elements enhance a film? How do you think these elements work in 2001?

I really don’t have very good answers to these questions; I’m just an average person who loves movies and has a good gut feeling about 2001. What are your thoughts on any of these questions? And what does 2001: A Space Odyssey mean to you?",movies,1605220512,Camboodoogins,True,1,36,2020-11-12

Is nostalgia cheap and lazy?,"I'm writing a movie. It's a thriller. The problem is, whenever I come up with a hurdle for my protagonist(s) to overcome, I realise that many of them could be easily solved by using mobile phones and/or the internet.

But I could get around this issue by setting my film in the 90s, before mobile phones/the internet were commonly used.

However, I find that, nowadays, so many films and TV shows are set in the past, and I mostly think that this is a cheap ploy to take advantage of the audience's nostalgia (e.g. 80s nostalgia in Stranger Things). 

I feel like this doesn't create anything new, it just feeds audiences almost exactly the same as they've seen before, only with better special effects.

I was wondering what you think about this dilemma: is it wrong to set a film in the past if only to make writing it easier?",movies,1605227490,ApolloTyphon,True,1,0,2020-11-12

"Dear Universal Pictures: Please, consider releasing the Amalgamated Dynamics cut of The Thing (2011).","The Thing (2011) wasn't as great as the 1982 ""original remake"" from cult director John Carpenter. But it was still enjoyable, and had a good deal of fan service, while also adding to the creature's lore. Plus, while any remake being comparable in quality to the classic would be a hard task, this one does it decently, maintining quite a lot of the atmosphere, and capturing the Lovecraftian horror surprisingly well.

However, the bad computer generated images and graphics killed the film for a good part of the original fanbase, and stopped a possible great expansion. Instead of adding into the horror of the creature, the visuals only dissipated any existing tension in most scenes it appears in. The most commonly cited example is the face-splitting scene in the helicopter, where the poor effects take out the suspension of disbelief of the watcher.

It saddens this fan - and many others - of the 1982 The Thing to know that Amalgamated Dynamics' practical effects work was almost completely erased in post production. The information that such a cut, a ""Practical Visuals Cut"" might exist, left many waiting for a release, perhaps in physical media or select streaming services. Unfortunately, such version never came to the public.

In the light of the recent announcement of a new project involving the creature, by Universal's Blumhouse Pictures, it seems fit that a re-release of the 2011 The Thing film, in all its practical glory, would come now.

Please, Universal Pictures, consider this possibility.

"We’ve all seen jokes this year about it, but what do you all consider to be serious contenders in the Oscar race?","On all types of posts in this subreddit, I’ve come across dozens of posts about how Sonic or Bad Boys will be up for a best picture nom. Though in jest, I understand the sentiment. These are strange times, but I’m curious about what everyone thinks for serious Oscar contenders. 

Mank seems like a front runner for Best Picture, Best Actor, writing, directing etc. Even on a normal year this could potentially be the case given the buzz so far.

Trial of the Chicago 7 seems like a natural contender given the subject matter, and will likely get some acting/ writing noms as well. So it seems like it could be Netflix’s year.

Others have mentioned Borat 2. This is where the pandemic may have had an impact. I personally feel like on any normal year, Borat 2 wouldn’t get any noms. But here we are, and I don’t think it’s impossible. 

Tenet also seems like an obvious choice, given Nolan’s films typically garner some nods here or there. Again, I feel like on a typical year things may be different for this one, but now I wouldn’t say a best picture nom is out of the question.

Even though there plenty of good movies that have been released this year, I’d still be curious if the Academy would be willing to be less gung ho on the typical dramas and be more open to genre films. Palm Springs was a personal favorite of mine this year, and while on any other year it wouldn’t stand a chance, I’m hoping for a writing nom. Maybe a supporting nom for JK Simmons. Speaking of supporting, I’d throw my hat in the ring for Hugh Grant for The Gentlemen. He’s been nailing these off brand roles for him in this and Paddington 2, so I say, why not?

What do you all think? Is this the year to get some left field nominations, or will this still be business as normal as far as the Academy is concerned?",movies,1605235448,Androopidibly,True,1,40,2020-11-12

"Scene transitions in ""Once Upon a Time in America""","Revisited this masterpiece after a number of years and this time I was struck by how beautiful the scene transitions are and how they fit into one of the major themes of the movie: the passage of time. I think many lesser directors have had trouble finding a way to tie two timelines together elegantly. Take, for example, The Imitation Game- not a bad movie, but a pretty generic one, when the time transition happens, the conceit is overused; the main character in the ""present"" is telling the story of his ""past"" to a police officer (who is basically a stand-in for the audience) and the story cuts back and forth at obvious points. Even though it is technically not a voiceover, it serves the same purpose. Basic, unremarkable stuff. 

In ""Once"", transitions happen without narration and never at obvious points. The scene where old Noodles finds the loose board in the wall and peeks through it, the camera holds on his eyes for an extra few seconds. Then, we're shown a scene of the past where Deborah is dancing on the dusty stage. Also, notice the borders of the hole which Noodles is peering through slowly recede from the frame. Then the next cut back is a shot of a young Noodles. Amazing stuff.",movies,1605239447,baudinl,True,1,9,2020-11-12

Best Nick Cage Movie?,"Hello people, I am here on behalf of needing to have a debate/online discussion for my uni course. My professor did not specify what it had to be about, so here I am opening the discussion to you all to join me. What is the best Nicholas Cage movie? It can be live action or animated, and you must provide information/evidence on why it is.

For example, in my opinion Colour out of Space is Nicholas Cage's best movie. The special effects are believable and well done. The designs for the creatures and slow dissolve of the animals and people as the meteor takes effect is cleverly done and believable. Nicholas Cage, while not behaving unlike his usual antics, they fit in with the premise and plot of the money. His delusional words when things start to hit the fan along with his in general unnerving behaviour fit into the setting and create a stronger setting for the rest of the characters. It is a horror movie, and previous issues of family members are present in Nicholas Cage and help to steer along the plot and keep us the audience unsettled.

I’m trying to remember the title of a somewhat obscure movie based on a totally obscure autobiography about a Native American who was held against his will in a mental hospital and later became a psychologist. Definitely NOT Cuckoo’s Nest.,"It’s in color, probably made in the 60-80’s. I believe it takes place in the first half of the 20th century. 

I believe the plot is something like “A Native American is hospitalized due to extreme depression (or maybe even amnesia) accompanied with odd behaviors, and then is kept the hospital for an extended period because his resistance to assimilate into European culture is viewed as mental illness.”

Any ideas?",movies,1605049876,ellivibrutp,True,1,4,2020-11-10

That one kids movie,"I recently remembered a movie that i had watched when I was a kid, however I do not remember the title and I have tried searching on the internet with the memories I have of it but I have found nothing, but I do remember the plot. 

It resolves around a kid who I think is an orphan (but I’m pretty sure he lives with a personal trainer or something like that) and he is the prime target for bullies. He has a crush on this girl but he believes that he is not good enough for her, one day, I don’t remember how but he gets super strong. He ends up becoming famous and he goes on various talk shows. The person he lives with is just using him as a marketing tactic. One day he returns to his home town and he sees his crush, he now has the confidence to tell her but he is shot down since the girl believes that he has changed as a person. I don’t really remember the end but since it is a kids movie he probably changed back to his normal self. 

There is one scene I vividly remember, he is waking to school when he sees a dumpster, he decides to look through it and he finds a book bag, he then keeps it as his own. 

It’s been bugging me that I can’t remember the title so I was wondering if you guys could help me try and find it. It was an animated (or cgi) movie and it was once on Netflix, other than that and the plot I don’t remember much",movies,1605052545,OneRedAstronaut,True,1,7,2020-11-10

Freaky Review (2020) Starring Vince Vaughn - This Film Balances Horror and Humor and Is One Hell Of a Good Time!,"https://youtu.be/UMtZd-Ingrc

Freaky (2020) stars Vince Vaugh, who easily jumps from serial killer to a 17 year old teenage girl, for many of you this is the “Freaky Friday” teen rom-com with a mix of slasher film.

Pretty great body swap movie- and a great combination of horror and typical high school/raunchy teen comedy. Vince Vaughn is hilarious and at times and scary, depending on who he is at the time. 

The director, Christopher Landon has a real knack for this usually very difficult genre of horror comedy- he really is able to check all the important boxes for each genre without losing tempo. 

Highly recommended for those who enjoy the genre. One note- the death scenes are not for the squeamish. They are, at times absurd, but grounded, making them feel realistic. They are also very creative, graphic and at times, elaborate. So, you know, 'viewer discretion advise'",movies,1605054968,RedditTalking,True,1,0,2020-11-10

Name your favorite concert film,"My favorite concert film at the moment is 1984’s Stop Making Sense. You have the music of Talking Heads alongside the direction of Jonathan Demme and the cinematography of Jordan Cronenweth (Blade Runner). How could this not be my favorite concert film? It’s so good that I prefer to listen to the film’s soundtrack over the studio recordings. The recently released David Bryne’s American Utopia is a worthy companion piece to Stop Making Sense, if you’re interested in something with the same vibe.

All in all, what’s your favorite concert film? Example include Pink Floyd’s Live at Pompeii, The Last Waltz, and Glee: The 3D Concert Movie (if you wish to pick that).",movies,1605056111,ggroover97,True,1,69,2020-11-10
A frequent criticism of Law Abiding Citizen revolves around why Shelton forced himself into prison when he could have just wreaked havoc from the outside considering his expertise. I would disagree. It was very clever of Shelton to put himself into prison.,"I watched Law Abiding Citizen recently, having seen it a few times. It wouldn't be one of my favourite movies so I don't really have much skin in the game. I saw a recent discussion of the film some of its (well founded) flaws and one of them concerns the motive behind Shelton putting himself into prison and how it makes zero sense. However, I would disagree. 

There are the obvious reasons why Shelton is in prison. From a filmmaking standpoint, it makes sense because it gives the viewer plenty of scenes with the two main characters going toe to toe. It would be very difficult to capture the chemistry between the two if it was just over the phone etc. 

The other element to it, and this is my main point, is that Shelton going into prison gives Rice and the police a false sense of security that they are in total control. Once they get his confession to murdering Ames and Darby it's an easy conviction and they can move on with the rest of their lives. Rice underestimates Shelton and overestimates his total control of the situation.

This could be a stretch but this is similar to how he underestimated the impact of the plea deal with Darby. Rice thought he had total control of the case but lost a pre-trial motion concerning DNA evidence and then he lost further control when he made the deal with Darby without really considering Shelton. 

Going back to the present, Rice and the rest of the gang initially doesn't take Shelton's demands seriously, which ultimately crystallises in the death of Darby's attorney because the prison warden delayed the delivery of the steak. This is the first indication that Shelton is playing a different game and it takes a while for Rice to catch up. They think he must have a man on the outside and ultimately, some of Rice's closest friends die as a result of him underestimating Shelton and overestimating his own control over the situation. 

Overall, it's a solid enough flick with some warranted criticisms but Shelton placing himself in prison was central to highlight the inadequacies of Rice and the wider institution he represents. Just my two cents.",movies,1605056205,HanSoloHeadBeg,True,1,4,2020-11-10

"Favorite S Craig Zahler picture, been watching a lot of his work lately, Bone Tomahawk and Dragged Across Concrete were a couple of my favorites.","Watched him a few years ago with Brawl In Cellblock 99 and Bone Tomahawk. I really love the use of dialog, the blocking of his cinematography was always really really good. I really love Dragged Across Concrete because of how much it reminds me of Dog Day Afternoon, Zahler loves phones and the use of them in his films, Brawl In Cellblock 99 ends with our main character talking to his girlfriend an unborn child in a standoff much like Al Pacino. 

Zahler has often said a lot of his films are inspired by Syndey Lumet. I was always wondering as Jewish writer if he was saying something about how the Christian White male is harrassed marked for annihiliation in our society with Bradley's Christian cross tattoo, a statement of pride and persecution as the guards get justice by marking off his head with their boots after he fights. I watched Asylum Blackout and it reminded me a lot of Brawl in Cellblock 99 but about the subject of insanity, ego, and identity in the backdrop of an Asylum blackout/riot (original title of the movie was called Incident At Sans Asylum which sounds similar to Brawl In Cellblock 99)

The way he has to give up his Jewelry before he enters the facility and when he goes to Red Leaf the soldiers look very Nazi esque with their armbands and black uniforms, harsh treatment of ""redneck"" Bradley Thomas, a minority in a world full of violent gangs where the uniform of each prisoner is race, and the dehumanizing way the guards make bets on his height and even when he strips naked.

As a Native I found Bone Tomahawk really intense with how it reminded me similar to Shane, the day of savages, gunslingers, cutthroats was coming to an end with the way the we have the main characters at odds as they embark on their rescue for the main character's wife, she's a doctor and a rivet of progress, even the Native Troglodyte troglodyte's are a metaphor for the violent Native ways coming to an end as the days of the wild west come to an end, the use of bone tools and weapons is a nice visual metaphor for the regression back to something more savage, the way Natives use wood and stone other more contemporary materials.

The way all the characters like the Bounty Hunter, the Sheriff, and the cut-throat criminal are eaten and killed by the Natives, signifying the days of guns and bloody slaughter are coming to an end, the surviving naïve but optimistic survivor Deputy, the Doctor and her husband walk off back to Hope Springs as 3 shots ring out, signifying the last of the dead of Trogoldytes, and the birth of a new age.

Dragged felt a metaphor for how cellphones distort our reality not just with the controversial subject matter with both Officers using brutal methods to subdue their criminal, the way everyone has their one pov and morality, the way the Dealer was running out on his girlfriend, and his girlfriend ratted him out to save herself, and the way they lied to her just to find out the drugs. But nobody would know the full truth behind the video they watched of Ridgeman with his foot on Diaz head, just a cop brutilizing a minority.

Then the final standoff with Tory Kittles character Henry getting video footage of the hostage shooting  at the other main characters to protect her family from being killed by her hostage takers, the public and news wouldn't understand, they'd just see a mother of 3 shooting 2 corrupt cops and one shooting her in the face, even though the one with the camera was the one who helped create the situation where that mother was taken hostage and given the gun.

The title being not only about ""police brutality"" but also the two main characters dragging their best friends bodie's to hide the evidence of their doings, dragging their secrets over concrete to create a better tomorrow. The way one character proposes to his wife over the phone and she gets angry and says no to his proposal because of how ""lazy"" and ""unromantic"" he asked it but little does she know he's going into a situation where he might not come back so this is the most serious and intimate time and way he could ask at the time.

Puppet Master The Third Reich was just Zahler having a good time with the comedy and saying a few things about being Jewish and even though being an atheist he finds a sense of empowerment to express subjects as The Third Reich, turning the Nazi's into nothing more than plotpoints and movies for him to express himself.",movies,1605060502,ShamusLovesYou,True,1,10,2020-11-10

I watched Nocturnal Animals last night. Can someone tell me if it was good or not?,"I’m not a smart man, so I’ll put my thoughts in bullet points. 

-	Amy Adams was more annoying than anything. I hated her character. I’m assuming that was kind of the point. 
-	Holy fucking shit do I love Michael Shannon. It’s maybe never happened ever that Gyllenhaal has been outshined by someone, but I think Shannon did, and he dragged this movie to the finish line. He’s incredible. 
-	What was the opening credits fat naked lady thing all about?
-	was this entire thing about amy adams being an awful person and realizing it at the end when she got stood up?
-	was she stood up? am i missing some kind of timeline weirdness where the ex doesn’t exist?

I liked it, but it felt like it was *trying* to be deeper than it was. So, I’m confused as to if it was deeper, or if I saw it exactly for what it was: AA’a character sucked, and JG’s character called her out on it?

The Fellowship of the Ring is a low-key horror movie.,"I'm convinced The Fellowship of the Ring is a low-key horror movie.

The Fellowship of the Ring is probably my favorite of the trilogy. I will never forget seeing it for the first time...and being scared shitless. 

After watching it again, I'm now convinced it is a low-key horror movie. 

One scene that sticks out in particular is the scene is the ""Get off the road!"" scene. The whole mood of the scene changes when that Wraith shows up. His horse has bloody hooves with nails sticking out, glowing red eyes. Then he starts sniffing the air, trying to find the ring. SUPER CREEPY. Creepy bugs and a centipede start squirming to get away from the Wraith. Then Frodo goes into this creepy trance, almost putting on the ring. 

Also, everyone is vulnerable and anyone could bite the dust, much like a horror movie. When I first watched The Fellowship of the Ring, I never even heard of LOTR. My dad took me because he was really into it during his college years and knew I'd be down with it. Was I ever! But I was in constant anxiety, because after Gandalf ""died"", I felt like ANY of the characters could be killed off. Nobody is safe! Scary orc-men want to fucking eat their flesh. And when Merry and Pippin got carried away, I was like, ""Yeah, they're gonna die too. No way they're living.""

I've seen it happen with the Star Wars franchise (the prequels get all the love now), Spider-Man 3 got a lot of love too after the Amazing Spider-Man.

The Terminator franchise is another one, some say that Terminator 3 and Salvation are suddenly good because we got Genisys and Dark Fate...

‘Knock Knock’ starring Keanu Reeves,"I reveal quite a few spoilers in this. That’s why I had to put Spoilers, but this is more of a discussion. 

I had high hopes for this movie seeing that Keanu Reeves was the star. Viewing the trailer, I thought it was going to be an enticing action movie. 

I was greatly disappointed when it turned out that it was exactly what I was hoping it wouldn’t be. It was just about some guy who has a threesome with a couple women who show up at his house, and you have to bear through and suffer with the characters as everyone ruins his life.

The entire time it was like a bad memory you try to avoid thinking about. To throw in the family aspect of it where they’re trying to FaceTime his wife and children with his genitalia out is honestly where I wanted to turn the movie off. And there are so many uncomfortable scenes throughout that aren’t interesting, you just want to look away. 

It wasn’t funny, it wasn’t too clever because every ‘twist’ was predictable, and it didn’t add anything positive to my life. Especially the ending message, “It doesn’t matter how much they love their families, they’re all the same.” Referring to all men with families being willing to have sex with random girls that show up at their house. Like, huh? That’s such a shifty message to send to couples who watched that movie. There are also some great men out there and seems to be completely degrading family men. What’s the point of the movie? 

I see the obvious message behind it, ‘don’t cheat on your spouse’. But in my opinion it could have been delivered in a much more thought provoking way. I thought it was going to be about so much more than the sex and the girls, but that’s pretty much all it was. It was pretty disappointing. I really didn’t want to see genitalia and sexual things drawn onto pictures of his children, either. 

The person I was watching it with said that the boys line at the end, “Dad really did have a party” was the funniest and best part of the movie. In my opinion, the best line was when Louis said, “You can’t pull one over on me, I’m from Oakland. I know two ghetto bitches when I see them!” Or something along those lines. Just paraphrasing here. 

If you like to be disturbed in the same way it’s disturbing to step in cold water with socks on, then this is a great movie for ya!",movies,1604874777,woodenmug,True,1,8,2020-11-08

The genius behind Rattlesnake Jake (Rango),"As soon as Rango’s charade had been solidified, as soon as he kills the bird and becomes the town sheriff for his deed, we are told about him, Rattlesnake Jake. He killed the previous Sherif. He was built up throughout the film as this serious threat, built up to be this dangerous outlaw that needs to be dealt with... and then he shows up. A lesser movie would’ve made him some kind of small snake with a gun, probably to hammer in the message that: anyone can be anything and that you’re in charge of who you are... “but we know better... don’t we.” Instead we get one of the most intimidating animated villains of all time, a massive cold blooded killer with enough bullets to massacre the entire town. In front of everyone who believed in him, he proceeds to tear apart Rango’s story, all the lies he told, all the rumors he started, and he does it not because he was hired too, he does it because Rango is an insult to legends everywhere. Rattlesnake Jake symbolizes everything Rango is not, symbolizes exactly what it looks like to actually live up to the legend, at this point, all Rango is saying he is. And because of this, Rango has no idea what to do, Jake is a legend, and he is just him. So when he leaves and returns, ready to live up to his own legend, it makes it that much more satisfying, because he just beat a legend fair and square, he didn’t cheap shot him, he didn’t lie or cheat... he won.",movies,1604887188,soup100,True,1,5,2020-11-08

I just do not get why people defend Johnny Depp.,"I just do not get why people defend Johnny Depp. He's a good actor with questionable work ethics. I mean even if he's not abusive or if we dismiss the problem with Amber Heard, There are many behaviors that made me understand why he's a complicated person, which is a diplomatic statement for he's a nightmare on set/production process.

[Here's an excerpt from THR Article 3 years ago.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/johnny-depp-a-star-crisis-insane-story-his-missing-millions-1001513)

&gt; Still, sources close to the production report tales of excessive drinking, physical fights with Heard and constant lateness on set, which often left hundreds of extras waiting for hours at a time. Time and again, Bruckheimer, an assistant director and a flotilla of Disney executives led by production chief Sean Bailey were forced to huddle and debate how to handle their star's tardiness. ""He's not a morning person,"" quips one member of that group.

Also, a producer from ""Waiting For Barbarians"" seems to confirm this. [The Tweet is in Indonesian.](https://twitter.com/ted_kho/status/1325369381468041217)

4 amazing films I recently saw by master filmmaker Zhang Yimou,"I watched four of ZHANG YIMOU'S  films last week on a little marathon and was so impressed with his storytelling and masterful directing. Many of you probably know this filmmaker from his hit Wushu film ""HERO"", but these others, that are totally different (not kung fu), if you are a cinephile, you really should see. 

Here are the 4 films with some commentary :

TO LIVE (1994) incredible drama spanning many years about a family adapting to war and change during Mao's great leap forward/cultural revolution. This was really informative about the Chinese culture during that time period. 

RAISE THE RED LANTERN (1991) : a new mistress marries into a  new husbands labyrinthian mansion, but its more like a prison, as she must navigate the conniving other mistresses. It kind of felt like a dark fairytale meets the ""hell is other people"" theme of  Jean paul Sartre's play ""NO EXIT"" 

THE ROAD HOME (1999): this was one of the most wholesome movies i have ever seen. Here we get to see a young and fresh ZHang Ziyi (of crouching tiger fame) go all out to win true love. Really nice soundtrack, and such a sweet and heartwarming story, without it being schmaltzy. 

NOT ONE LESS (1999) : a 13 year old girl is given responsibility for one month to teach a small villages schoolhouse lessons. Really awesome tale about one of the most persistent and strong willed protagonists Ive seen in a story in a long time. This film beautifully illustrates the theme of ""no child left behind"" in educating children in a society.

Watching shows like films and watching films like shows. Anyone else?,"I feel like the way I consume media is the opposite of how it's intended, but I get the most enjoyment out of it this way, and I wanted to see if I'm alone in this. (BTW, everything below only applies when I'm alone. When watching with a group, I'll obviously be watching the normal way).

When I watch a film, I begin open minded and focused, allowing the movie to pull me into its world. When the movie is great, I don't get up or press pause for the entire film, and if I like it enough I'll oftentimes actually restart the movie again from the minute the credits roll and watch it all the way through one more time. A great film that completely engages you from scene to scene is a priceless experience.

However, most of the time...that doesn't happen. I'll be about 25 minutes into the movie, and I'm not feeling that movie magic. So I'll pause it, stretch and grab a snack. Maybe call a friend. Maybe read some trivia about the movie, browse the net, etc. Then, when I'm ready, go back to the movie. Sometimes the movie clicks and I finish the rest of it after this early break. But other times, the magic still isn't there, and I'll continue watching 30 minute ""episodes"" and taking 30 minute breaks until the film is finished. I'll often even come back the next day and finish it up.

However, when I watch a show I love, I'm all about binge watching. I can consistently watch 3 hours worth of episodes in every sitting. I get into a certain flow going from episode to episode, and if the quality is high enough, I never get bored. It may be due to the connection to the characters or the serialized style, but whatever it is, a great show never loses my attention.

Obviously, films are meant to watched in one sitting and shows are meant to be watched an episode a day/episode a week. There's a lot of discussion about how binge watching shows can actually hurt the experience. But for some strange reason, it feels most natural for me to do the opposite most of the time (split up films and binge watch shows). And I'm actually more of a movie guy than a TV guy, which makes this even more odd. Anyone else do this, or is it just me?",movies,1604891734,Inovox,True,1,8,2020-11-08

"What is your most ridiculous, petty, movie pet peeve?","Everyone has pet peeves, but I think also everyone has movie pet peeves that drive them up the wall. Sure, there are common, warranted ones: over use of jump scares in horror movies, arbitrary ending twists that make no sense just so there can be a twist, etc.

But there are also more irrational pet peeves that make little sense as to why they drive you crazy, but every time it occurs you let out an audible UGH!! to the bewilderment of those around you. So, what are your irrational/petty movie pet peeves, and why do you think they drive you crazy?

Mine:

Once there are bad guys that show up on dirt bikes, I check out of the scene and they lose all credibility and I find whatever they do afterward laughable. Its happened in a few movies ive seen but the first one I remember was London Has Fallen a fun little popcorn movie. For some reason, I think, it seems like the makers of the movie are just trying to make the bad guys overtly cool and can imagine the makers of the movie being like: ""hmm rather than having the bad guys in cars or motorcycles, they'd be so much cooler on DIRT BIKES!!""

Like I said, the pet peeve is probably viewed as making no sense by others, but nonetheless it drives you up a wall!!",movies,1604896509,Fearless-Muffin,True,1,1140,2020-11-08

Knock knock movie,"I’m sure a bunch of us just watched this movie recently because of Netflix and the movie junkies saw it long ago. But anyways to the point:

This movie had such an amazing fucking premise. It had me hooked so hard trying to guess any twists and turns. Then the ending happened and it just made me feel empty inside like I wasted my time. Potential twists in my mind were

1. Karen (his wife) set it all up (my favorite)
2. Keanu breaks free and kills them (either goes to jail or successfully proves it was them)
3. Karen calls the police and they shoot the girls down (because the FaceTime went through or because her statue was missing)

Good or Bad: The League of Extraordinary Gentleman (2003),"The death of Sean Connery lead me to watching this movie for the 1st and well...you can tell it was made in the early 2000s. I love the concept of the movie, having all of these classic literary characters team up to form this Victorian era Avengers, it just feels so underwhelming. 

The action is pretty forgettable and the mediocre CGI looks so dated, even by 2003 standards. The look of the film was also very dull. Early DCEU movies had more color than this. Even the film’s aesthetic, which is trying to go for this steampunk style, feels underdeveloped. Captain Nemo’s submarine and this pre-automobile car should feel cooler than they already are. The mechanical spider from Wild Wild West was more interesting and I don’t even like Wild Wild West. 

What do I like? Once again, the concept is cool and seeing all these characters get these quasi-superpowers was nice. I also like some of the smaller character moments like Mina Harker trying to act all proper after camping out on someone. 

Overall, even though I’m not calling TLoEG a masterpiece, I do see it becoming guilty pleasure material similar to The Mummy or Van Helsing. If anything, I would like to see a reboot either on the big screen or a TV series. Who knows, maybe Sherlock Holmes and Oliver Twist can join the League next time!",movies,1604898923,ggroover97,True,1,56,2020-11-08
Knock Knock had an important message that everyone seems to be missing.,"I watched Knock Knock the other day on Netflix. I was disturbed by the aspects of it that were trying to be funny. 

When the girls seduced him, he was an asshole who gave in. That is what most people say these situations where the man is being pursued. However, women always talk about how coercion is rape. Yet, with a man, he's an asshole that couldn't keep his dick in his pants. The movie opened the dialogue to discuss the fact that this is one of the biggest double standards between men and women. 

If coercion is rape, the men are being raped also. If this was a woman and two teenage boys, people would have been boycotting Netflix worse than when Cuties was released.",movies,1604898960,llama_mama86,True,1,12,2020-11-08

Review: Fletch is a fake Beverly Hills Cop,"I used to think it was funny but rewatching other seems like Chevy Chase trying to do his best Beverly Hills Cop without the buddy cop routine.

The music is sequencer 80s synth almost identical and it follows the same secret mystery routine.

It’s just not that funny either.  Either Chevy is overrated or Eddie is just so gifted, Chevy just can’t carry a movie.

Which is a shame because National Lampoons Christmas is still such a classic.

Fletch is a 1985 American neo-noir comedy thriller film directed by Michael Ritchie and written by Andrew Bergman. Based on Gregory Mcdonald's popular Fletch novels, the film stars Chevy Chase as the eponymous character. It co-stars Tim Matheson, Dana Wheeler-Nicholson, Geena Davis and Joe Don Baker.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 1971,"Rewatching Charlie and the chocolate factory for the first time in easily 15 years and am thoroughly enjoying it. Two main things struck me whilst watching it however;

Firstly the jokes that went over my head as a child make it so much more entertaining to watch as an adult. I’m surprised how funny the teacher is within the first half an hour, especially when struggling to figure out 2% of 1000 which went over my head as a child.

The random snippets of people literally debating whether to pay a box of chocolate for their husbands life or not etc made me laugh too. When I was younger I didn’t like those bits and a lot of the more subtle jokes because I didn’t understand them but now it’s made the film so much more enjoyable. 

Secondly and the main point, how was Slugworth at the place where the golden tickets were opened every time to whisper in the ears of the winners? I don’t think that’s fully explained. Supposedly the 5 tickets were randomised across the globe, how in the hell could they be tracked to the exact location AND moment they’d be opened?

I know it’s a magical world where anything is possible and I’m all for poetic licence but .... the Slughorn bit is just a tad far fetched for what otherwise holds up as a damn good film.

"as great as they were, i find older movies to be a bit boring","I am a movie fan, I am not a critic and i enjoy a good blockbuster with pop-corn and watch 99% of the movies in the threatre even traveled 200 miles for imax. 

now I have been watching older movies and franchises on hbo max.. not by choice of course but i find movies pre-80's even if they are supposed to be great i find they are slow boring no intensity, faded colours bad camera angles. 

I know that might be a blasphemous thing to say and compare movies then an now seeing all the technology that we have at disposal. 

I have also noticed the movies are darker in tone.. look at superman 1 from 1980 and man of steel.. completely different tone. now movies are darker more intense less cartoonish.. even if the one in the 80's is highly rated and the other not so much.. 

another example are the halloween movies. tried to watch the early versions and i get no thrills perhaps because i am not so fond of slasher movies.. i prefer the likes of conjuring, insidous, etc 

again i am not film critic and i think reading and basing your bluray purchases on critics is the shortest way to a crappy movie collection.",movies,1604716613,dan7843292,True,1,17,2020-11-06

"Secret identity, vanished, murder, etc. What's it called though?","I watched this movie in highschool, almost 20 years ago. It was old Even then. I think maybe anywhere from the late 60s to late 90s. Here is the plot from what I remember: 

A french village. Medieval times possibly. A real big JERK hates his wife, his friends, his life. He is illiterate, ignorant, brash and just a giant A-Hole. He is hated by his community in turn. He vanishes, suddenly. Life goes on. 

Several years pass. He returns, very mysteriously. Suddenly, he is literate, kind, empathetic, friendly, wise. He plays with the kids he formally hated. He is gentle with people he once freaked out on. He teaches his wife to write her name. He has basically become the Man. 

The villagers eventually hang him; they don't believe he is the same man who vanished years ago, but instead an imposter with nefarious purposes. 

You never find out if he was legit or an imposter.

"What movie has the line ""good. again."" After it's training montage?","So I know this is a long shot but I've been trying to remember a movie based on one scene that keeps playing in my head.
The movie is a sci-fi/fantasy, I'm pretty sure since the majority of movies that I watch are.

In the scene, the teacher is training the protagonist. It's really challenging training with sticks if I recall correctly. At the start of the montage, the protagonist is terrible: the teacher beats them each time. By the end of the montage, they're better and they finally deliver what would be a fatal blow to the teacher. They're visibility surprised and proud, and the teacher simply says:
 ""Good. Again"", 
Before tossing the stick back to them and the protagonist has this incredulous look on their face.

As I said, this is a long shot and I'm not 100% sure on anything that I've written here except for when the teacher says that. I may be wrong about them sparring with sticks/poles but that's what I remember.",movies,1604529861,PRNCK,True,1,15,2020-11-04

From what I remember it was a black and white movie kinda like tremors. People were being attacked by what I believe was giant worms or some other type of underground monster. I think it was set in the early 1900s because they did have vehicles but also had a older model of gun.  One thing that’s different from tremors that makes me think it was a different movie altogether is that the monsters were able to get close to the surface of the ground and move vehicles.

Films whose true meanings were discovered years later or never discovered at all?,"Let me explain a bit better what i'm after:

Let's say that the director of the movie, lead writer, someone from  production etc. (it doesn't matter - generally someone associated with film) decides to reveal that universally accepted understanding of that movie isn't true and that there are hints in the film that are suggesting the real meaning, yet noone has managed to piece it together?

I'm interested in examples of something like this happening throughout the history of film, whether the fanbase managed to piece the puzzle together or if it remained a mistery waiting to be solved.",movies,1604535462,k1ngn1kola,True,1,0,2020-11-04
How do you think Marc Forster's 'World War Z' (2013) would be regarded if it simply had a different name?,"To start off, I absolutely loved the book and think it would make an incredible series/miniseries/anthology if it was adapted correctly however I've just rewatched World War Z and was reminded by how much I enjoyed the film.

It's regularly referred to as a terrible adaptation, which is admittedly correct, but I think it's a pretty damn interesting and original addition to the zombie genre, which also features some great action scenes/set-pieces (even if there is some janky CGI in many places). It's pretty relentless in terms of action between the talky bits.

I love the interpretation of the zombies as creatures who swarm like ants (I believe that has been stated as an influence on their climbing etc) and are relentless hunters who pose a real threat to everyone.  I love how Gerry observes them and learns details such as ""turning time"", alerts and weaknesses.

Even if Pitt's character is a bit bland, I appreciate his place as a resourceful observer who is focused but compassionate at every turn. Ok, it's probably a bit far-fetched that he survives each encounter but magazine arm guards are just genius and he performs well in the role.

The globe-trotting nature of the film is great and we get a swift insight into the trials and tribulations that have faced the rest of the world rather than just within one nation as we normally see. 

Basically I just feel it has been mistreated a bit due to comparison and I'm really disappointed that the Fincher sequel seems to have died off too. Would have been fascinating to see his take on the genre!

Anyway, how do you guys feel about the film and what would you call it instead of World War Z so that it was treated independently of the book?",movies,1604535498,MissingLink101,True,1,0,2020-11-04

"What do you guys think of the movies ""THE WAVE 2015"" and ""THE QUAKE 2018""?","Where do I start with these films.
Was looking for some disaster films to watch cause I was feeling it for whatever reason and stumbled across the Norwegian film ""the wave 2015"" and I am blown away by how down to earth and realistic it is, the character building and tension is better than most Hollywood films and it gets you to care about the family.
There were some silly action scenes that somehow people survived but strange things happen I guess, but other than that the realism of the disaster I feel made the film that muhh more enjoyable and jaw dropping.
So I finished watching that and then saw there was a sequal ""the quake"" so I was like straight away clicked play.
And crap did they take the wave and turn it up to eleven, this film makes you feel tiny, it doesn't shy away from the toll off the death count from the first film on the main protagonist and his family, but what really got me was the death of his wife in a good half hour of absolute chaos where it left me feeling speechless and emotionally exhausted.

By far my favourite disaster movies, just ahead of the likes of dantes peak and some others.

Turns out it's the same director, and I don't know what Debra Granik has going on, but it's totally antithetical to a ""normal"" story structure and movie making, and I love it.

Thomasin McKenzie and Ben Foster absolutely kill as a father and daughter. Foster at some point needs to get a lifetime achievement award for the best actor no one really knows...Also, the character you love, but is as close to the line of an awful person while the audience still loves him.

To say this is a slow burn is putting it mildly, but it's also got some of the best cinematography I've seen in a long time, and I think as time goes by it will only gain in audience appreciation.

[Help] External Locus Control in Movie characters,"I am going to preface this by saying if this is the wrong subreddit for this, I am very sorry, I have nowhere else to turn.

Anyways, 

I just started my college semester two weeks ago and things have been going great! (yay) up until this assignment (boo). The assignment is asking about internal and external locus control, which one, I've never covered before in past schooling, and two, I honestly don't watch many movies. 

External Locus Control is defined as *""the belief that one's behavior will not lead to valued reinforcement that is available in the environment and therefore not under one's* ***control****. The occurrence of reinforcement is believed to be a function of factors out of one's* ***control*** *such as luck, chance, or randomness. ""*

OR

 ""Blame outside forces for their circumstances; Often credit luck or chance for any successes; Don't believe that they can change their situation through their own efforts; Frequently feel hopeless or powerless in the face of difficult situations""

&amp;#x200B;

My question to you all is which all of your movie knowledge, can you please help me find a character whose entire mindset in a movie is that of external locus control? The essay is due Wednesday and with work right now, I can't binge movies enough to find a suitable movie character with enough supporting evidence to get a good grade.

Thank you so much.",movies,1604368116,DavidPlaysLife,True,1,5,2020-11-02
Looking for a certain movie.,"So, I recently was on Netflix and saw this one movie/show whatever called 'Spirit, Riding Free', and it  reminded me of an old movie I watched maybe... 5-7 Years ago with my aunt? And I cannot for the LIFE of me remember what the name is. And I was pretty young, so I can't name the decade. Basically, it is a 2D Animated movie based in the old american west that is centered around a tan horse, who goes on some journey or something like that.

Some key parts I remember is that the horse is forced into some competition of trying to knock some guy off of his back, the horse falls in love with a white horse, and I believe the climax was a train derailment or something. If someone could tell me the name of a movie like that it would be greatly appreciated.

Well, I guess it isn't the end of the world if I don't get an answer... But I just want it off of my chest.",movies,1604368208,Fennec-The-Fox,True,1,11,2020-11-02

"""The One"" starring Jet Li, was such a cool concept for a movie. It would've been even more spectacular with current special effects technology.","
It was such a wild ride. Plenty of cool effects (for the time), action, and fight scenes, without taking itself too seriously.

In some ways, it felt more like a video-game, than a movie. It was just really unique the way the story unfolded. Before anyone jumps down my throat, I'm not saying it was underrated, or some action masterpiece, it was just a fun movie that kept you pumped throughout. 

If I could compare it to something, I'd say maybe a mash-up of **The Matrix**, and the **Crank** series, with Jason Statham. Has elements of both, but with parallel universes thrown in. https://ibb.co/7rBq9QW",movies,1604375614,zeoplex,True,1,255,2020-11-02
Is there a movie about your favorite sport that depicts its action or the culture around it very well?,"I am a basketball player and runner but I can’t say I love any realistic movies about either. 

My favorite sports movies are 

*Goon/Goon 2*: comedies about a fighter who plays hockey  
*Miracle*: Disney’s take on the ‘Miracle on Ice’ story of the USA Hockey team. 
*The Greatest Game Ever Played*: the story of Francis Ouimet’s win against some of the best golfers in the world. 
*Rocky* I &amp; II: I don’t want to talk to you like you’re dumb. You know what these are.
*Cinderella Man*: boxer James J Braddock’s redemption in the eyes of his family and the country after being laid low by the Great Depression
*Creed 2*: Apollo Creed’s son Adonis fights the son Ivan Drago

WNUF Halloween Special is the greatest found footage film of all time,"Just watched  The WNUF  Halloween Special  and got to say it's the the greatest found footage movie iv'e scene in my life. This film takes found footage to a new level, being an a actual ""Found footage "", as in this a lost piece of media that you found. How do they do that? Well hers the premise is The movie is the 'WNUF Halloween Special' is a vhs recording of the Infamous 1987 'WNUF Halloween Special broadcast. The special follows A local TV personality leading  a team of supernatural investigators, including an exorcist, into the darkest corners of a supposedly haunted house. Sounds like a typical found footage film right? wrong?

The brilliant thing about the way this film structured. The film opens with a  spoof  local news broadcast being shot edited and written like one, It's about the length of a regular  local news broadcast and has fake commercials!  But what makes it blriant is this news broadcast and the commercial give you clues and  exposition along the way giving you hints of what's going to happen later. 

This film should be the gold standard of found footage movies, and I highly recommend it",movies,1604184437,SnooBananas720,True,1,7,2020-10-31

I think people need to consider film more seriously,"I think movies are very important. People don't watch movies like I do, I mean seriously, like when someone misses the point in a movie like ""Joker 2019"" or ""Fight Club (1999)"" or ""V for Vendetta (2006)"" I can't help but feel like they never watched the movie. Like when Blade Runner 2049 is talking about the lack of intimacy in today's young men, I think people miss that. Or like when people think the Last Jedi is a good continuation of Star Wars, I just can't believe it! 

Its like nobody loves movies the way I do. What's up with that? Where are the real movie appreciators at?",movies,1604187580,LurchingSaucer,True,1,25,2020-10-31
"How many of you remember the haunting and nostalgia inducing film The Halloween Tree (1993)? Ray Bradbury does the voice over for the film, and it is based off his 1972 book of the same name.","I watch it every year on Halloween and it is one of those films that makes people really excited when they are reminded of it (if they saw it). It aired on Cartoon Network and maybe some non cable channels sometime later in the nineties (because otherwise I may not have seen it). The movie is only 1 hour and 9min long, but it covers a lot of ground. The four main characters plan to go trick or treating, but end up on a wild chase, following a friend whose life is in danger.

In their adventure they learn about how Halloween has been celebrated in the past and in different cultures. Without spoiling it, I do want to mention that the four friends have to make a very heavy decision.

I absolutely adore the soundtrack and the sound editing. It's a quiet film in a way, but I think it would appeal to children aged 8 and up. It isn't scary really at all, but the ending is pretty ""deep"" but also positive. I think it could bother a child who doesn't like spooky movies. It walks a strange balance, so take my recommendations on that front with that in mind.",movies,1604187660,Hitflyover,True,1,3,2020-10-31

I am watching the 2nd movie right now and still blown away at all the facial expressions the doll can pull off.  The gleeful manical laughter, the rage, the snarling and curling of the lips. There is not one moment where you do not believe that Chucky is a real possessed doll.

I really don't like the live action Mulan,"tl;dr: The new Mulan sucks

I'm Chinese, so I was excited as hell that we were getting a new, grittier Mulan that seemed to pay more homage to the original legend, and was more respectful to Chinese culture. I love the animated one, but it isn't necessarily the best representation of the myth. That plus, I was a huge fan of Liu Yifei, since she's been in some of my favorite shows. Also Donnie Yen and Jet Li were going to be in it. 

And then I watched it. I don't know how a movie marketed as a truer depiction of the myth managed to f\*ck up so much. First of all, it's not that entertaining of a movie objectively. It's got some nice shots but it's kinda boring and messy feeling. Second, as I mentioned before, it takes the myth and Chinese culture and pretty much sh\*ts all over it.

To forward Disney's woke stance, they made it so Mulan couldn't practice kung fu because she was a woman and people didn't want women to be strong. That's not true. Women weren't really restricted from practicing kung fu. Similarly, they added a female, shape-shifting witch? What was the point? Witches really aren't a big part of Chinese legend. I'm pretty sure they just added her so they could have more Strong Females Characters. As a young, Chinese, girl, I don't need to see a shape-shifting witch to feel empowered. Hua Mulan is enough of a feminist statement on her own. She didn't need extra feminism injected into her story. Also, they tried so hard to distance themselves from Mushu, that they completely got rid of the dragons and replaced them with a phoenix that randomly showed up. Wtf? Dragons are an important symbol in Chinese culture. That's why Mushu was a dragon. The movie could have easily had a dragon motif that wasn't culturally insensitive.  And then they got rid of Li Shang just to add another bland love interest. The cricket was a person for some reason when, it could have been a good luck charm given to her by her family or something like that. Mulan was randomly taking off her armor in the middle of a war. There was just so much crap like that. I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't.

"In this crazy year, 1978's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" is THE Halloween movie to watch.","1978's ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" is the perfect Halloween movie to encapsulate 2020. It's got conspiracy paranoia, mistrust of government and the police, social distancing, anti-establishment, outright anarchy, and overwhelming fear of a viral infection, which like Coronavirus, duplicates living cells.

Want more? How about a young Jeff Goldblum at his Goldblume-ness. Leonard Nimoy in a very Spock-like role, human-face dog, and Robert Duvall dressed as a priest on a kid's swing.

**7** Jackie Brown - 7.5/10 (Loved Sam L Jackson in this movie)

**6** Inglorious Basterds - 7.5/10 

**5** Reservoir Dogs - 8/10 

**4** Kill Bill (1+2 are basically just one movie) -.8/10 

These 3 might be controversial

**3** Pulp Fiction - 8/10

Jake Gyllenhaal was absolutely amazing and terrifying in Nightcrawler.,"[Jake](https://ibb.co/nb0KL52) was simply a tour de force here. I mean what an effectively intriguing, yet imposing character. I had no idea what to expect going into it. I love how they scrapyard scene very quickly shows you that he is indeed the antagonist, right from the start (did he straight up murder that guy btw?).  

Every time he was onscreen, there was palpable tension, like he was going to snap any moment. The tension was insane. Especially when he was interacting with his sidekick, I kept thinking ""he's totally gonna bash this dude's brains in at some point"" because of how annoying/stupid he was being. 

I love how we watched him transform from this desperate weirdo begging for a job, to this completely threatening, in-control weirdo, who made *everyone* do what he said. So many good moments where he just absolutely reeked of psychopathy. The movie does a good job of not making you feel bad for him at any point. He's just shitty and weird from the start, and that just snowballs with every act.

My favorite interaction has to be when he brings the suburb massacre footage to Nina. She tries to lowball him, and then he snaps, and makes her comply with all the demands he has. You could feel her fear at how suddenly unhinged, yet calm he became. 

""*Now when I say... That I want these things, I* ***mean*** *that I want them, and I don't want to have to ask again. And the last thing that I want Nina... Is for you to do the things that I ask you to do when we're alone in your apartment...* ***Not like the last time!***""",movies,1604191362,zeoplex,True,1,78,2020-10-31

Horror movies for someone who can't watch horror movies?,"Hey there. I love thriller movies, those ones that make you want to enter inside the screen just to warn the character that they need to run.
For example, I can think on top of my head on Paranoia (that old one with Shia Labesomething) and The Invisible Man (a recent one with, of course, a invisible man).

But I would also like to watch some horror movies. The thing is that gore is a guaranteed No (my pressure goes down for some reason).

Murder Party (2007) is the perfect halloween movie.,"Murder Party (2007) is the perfect Halloween movie.

Being a huge movie buff (with an emphasis in horror) every October I end up binging a ridiculous amount of horror movies. 


I have tried all of the classics, and nothing has ever given me the same Halloween vibe that Murder Party gives me every year. 


This movie does everything right in my opinion and honestly I catch new things every year. If you are a fan of movies such as Trick R’ Treat or Tucker &amp; Dale I think this is a must add for this time of the year.


The mix of horror and comedy is just perfect for October 31st whether you are stuck at home alone or at a party with friends.

The Mysterious Stranger scene from Adventures of Mark Twain,"I love how, without any violence directed at the children, nearly everything Satan says in this eerie sequence is intended to hurt or insult them.

The very first words he speaks starts with ""hell"" and he introduces himself as an angel, a technical truth, and politely invites them into the abyss.

He then creates a garden and offer the children fruit.  Considering what happened the last time this situation arose, this supposedly nice gesture of welcome is instead a joke made at the their expense.

Following this train of thought, the devil offers them clay to create their own people and mockingly reenacts the creation of humanity while showing them to be small and petty creatures.

He then destroys it all, and defends his actions by saying that not only has he done nothing wrong, he can't, since he doesn't know right from wrong.  This is also said at the children's expense in that they ate the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil, and should know better.

Confronted with the children's horror at this senseless creation and destruction, he shrugs, and points out that more life can always be created so what does it matter?  He ends with a speech devaluing life as a thing so ephemeral and easily created, it is empty and worthless, while he himself ironically falls into an empty abyss.",movies,1604198353,SuddenlyStar,True,1,7,2020-10-31

Thoughts on The Godfather Trilogy (first viewing),"Just finished watching The Godfather trilogy for the first time and just wanted to share some thoughts:

-1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3
-first one was phenomenal and deserves all the praise it gets but I was honestly did not think the sequels were that great
-second one was decent too and I appreciate how it does something different than the original but I just found the story a bit more convoluted and the flashbacks didn’t really make sense in relation to the modern day parts (felt like they were just trying to make a reason to include Vito)
-that leads to my next point, this trilogy really suffered without Marlon Brando’s Vito Corleone I feel like he is the centerpiece of the franchise. Even though he only appears in the first, his impact is definitely felt for the rest of the trilogy and I think the sequels really needed him. Deniro did a fine job but he just wasn’t the same. It’s like if Darth Vader was only in a new hope, and not in TESB or Return of the Jedi. There was a huge Vito Corleone shaped hole in the franchise.
-third one started off ok, but it goes off the rails, Sofia Coppola was awful, the incest relationship was a huge WTF, and the ending was abrupt and not satisfying at all. Andy García was great though
-didn’t really like how the sequels climax kinda repeat the first one in that Michael is chilling (ie baptism, hanging out at his cabin, at the opera) while the camera cuts to people get murdered. I get it, it’s contrasting regular activities with brutal murders but you did it well in the first already, kinda lazy to just repeat that in both sequels.
-overall godfather 1 is a truly a masterpiece and I loved everything about it but the franchise as a whole is alright. I feel like the trilogy comes up in conversations when talking about greatest trilogies but in my personal opinion this trilogy doesn’t really hold a candle to stuff like LOTR or the original Star Wars trilogy",movies,1604013423,gildedart,True,1,9,2020-10-29

How is this possible? I tried googling it but can't find an explanation. The mpaa rules say two uses of the word Fuck or one use if it's used sexually make it an R rating. 

I obviously didn't mind it at all but I was curious how it got that rating. I've seen movies with far less cursing still get harsher ratings.",movies,1604013543,tunaburn,True,1,2,2020-10-29

Shrek Talk,"Today I was watching clips of various animated movies I loved as a kid and I stumbled upon the eating alone scene from the first Shrek movie. After watching it I honestly have to say it's one of my favorite scenes from any animated movie I've seen.


I'm not saying that for some shitty meme I mean it. Theres so many little details in this one minute or so scene that says so much about the character of Shrek's character. His forced smiles, the empty chair across from him thats prominent in the shot, and the look he gives over to the door feeling bad for Donkey but he doesn't in fear Donkey will judge him just like everyone else so he goes on with his meal acting like it never crossed his mind. I also really enjoy the detail you see in Shrek's house. All the hand made things that he most likely stole from nearby villages or stumbled upon in garbage cans or something. It really gives you a feel for his situation. Not to mention the music. It really gives you a comfy feeling yet also a lonely one. Its very relaxing but sad.

I'm not sure if this scene is talked about to death or not but I felt the need to share it and wanted to talk about it. Here's the scene [Eating Alone](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aZbjc0UHdBY&amp;t=27s)",movies,1604016496,midorii_hug,True,1,4,2020-10-29

Movies I know that it's not:

People under the stairs

Edward Scissorhands 2020,"Hear me out. There are all these Zoom movie script readings happening lately including the best of the beat as far as actor caliber. 

Wouldn't it be awesome to have the original cast of Edward Scissorhands re-read their parts o on said format with the exception of Tim Burton himself playing The Inventor? I feel like this would be awesome!

But who would narrate the script cues like Morgan Freeman did for Fast Times? Mark Strong maybe? Or maybe Mark Strong could be The Inventor and Burton read the cues?

"The 1990 film 'Ghost' is an outstanding genre bending film that hits every beat perfectly with it's casting, writing and pacing.","I saw snippets of 'Ghost' on TV as a kid, but never saw the full film until now, and holy shit. This movie is incredible!

The casting is just perfect. Patrick Swazye, Demi Moore, Whoopi Goldberg, and Tony Goldwyn all hit their marks and each one knocks their performance out of the park (Also, shoutout to Vincent Schiavelli as the ""GET OFF MY TRAIN"" ghost.)

The music is fantastic as well, which was composed by *Lawrence Of Arabia*  composer, Maurice Jarre.

The one thing about the film that blew my mind was the director, Jerry Zucker.

Yes, the man that wrote and directed *Airplane!*, *Top Secret*, and *The Naked Gun*, gets out of his comfort zone and shows Hollywood he can do dramatic films as well. 

I was only a baby when the film came out in 1990, but it must've been amazing to for a film like 'Ghost', which was made for $22 million, gross $500 million at the box office, and was the third highest grossing film of all time at that point behind E.T. and Star Wars. 

Definitely a film worth checking out!!",movies,1604024171,CaptainBroverdose,True,1,33,2020-10-29

The social media embargo on MANK is lifted. -first reactions,"The social media embargo on MANK is now lifted. I will post some reactions from critics here and keep this post updated for a few hours if it's allowed (feel free to delete this post if it's not.)

No surprise here, the first reactions are generally positive:

Joe Utichi: David Fincher's [**#Mank**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mank?src=hashtag_click) is a masterpiece, in the truest sense of the word. Absolutely riveting from start to finish; a filmmaker's meditation on the urgency of the creative process through the lens of Hollywood history...

Erick Anderson: **MANK** isn't really about the making of Citizen Kane; it's how the Hollywood machine props up and quickly tears down. Superb screenplay and structure, a technical marvel and eerily relevant. Good performances all but Arliss Howard, Tom Pelphrey and Amanda Seyfried stand out. [**#Mank**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mank?src=hashtag_click)

Matt Neglia: **MANK** is a cinematic jewel that reminds us why we love the movies. Intelligent &amp; thoroughly researched, this is a love letter from David Fincher where every single technical element is painstakingly created to match the time period. Gary Oldman delivers a masterful performance.

Steven Weintraub: David Fincher's [**#Mank**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mank?src=hashtag_click) is phenomenal. Everything from the brilliant sound design to the amazing performances makes it one of the best films of 2020. Cinephiles are going to LOVE this movie.

Erickohn: **MANK** is a peculiar labyrinth of a movie, a thrilling &amp; unpredictable approach to deconstructing Hollywood history in its own language. No, you won’t get a definitive CITIZEN KANE backstory (&amp; Orson emerges relatively unscathed); you’ll get a remarkable window into what it means.

Eric Davis: [**#Mank**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mank?src=hashtag_click) is a remarkable sight to behold w/ each shot so meticulously well crafted you’ll want to pause the film often just to stare at this thing. A frenetic &amp; authentic throwback that classic film buffs will adore. Are you a lover of provocative Hollywood stories? This is for you

[The Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/amanda-seyfried-mank-oscar-surprise-20201029/): A first look at **Mank** confirms that Gary Oldman and David Fincher are likely Oscar nomination bound, but the surprise is Amanda Seyfried would may just crash the Supporting Actress party. As for Best Picture? Nomination sure...

What's the deal with Ransom (1996)?,"*Ransom* is a 1996 thriller directed by Ron Howard. It's a loose remake of the 1956 movie *Ransom!* with Glenn Ford and Donna Reed. I'm always up for a good thriller movie and I'm always up to watch Ron Howard movies. However, I've noticed that Ransom isn't available to rent anywhere. You can't buy it digitally either. It seems the only way to watch it legally is to get the DVD/Blu-Ray, stream it on Sling, or  hope to catch it on TV. How can a Mel Gibson movie from the 90s be that hard to track down? 

Granted, the Blu-Ray isn't that expensive. On Amazon, you can find copies for around $10-15 but it seems strange how it isn't available to purchase or rent digitally. Does it have to do with the company that distributed the movie? In this case, the company is Touchstone (Disney). Does it have to do with them?",movies,1603838305,ggroover97,True,1,25,2020-10-27

Uncut Gems Deserves Another Oscar Run,"I was watching Hubie Halloween with my family this weekend and figured I’d finally get around to watching Uncut Gems. I needed to see Adam Sandler giving it his all. And my goodness did he give it his all.

How this man did not win the Oscar for this film is beyond me.  Sandler lost himself in that role you almost forget he churns out B movies for Netflix every year. I was on the edge of my couch the entire movie nearly crippled from the anxiety in this film. 

There has to be some Oscar loophole if they put this in theaters now even if people have to watch it at home.

Looper is such a great movie.,"Looper with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis is such an amazing movie to watch. The Sci-fi behind it is not overbearing and keeps it in a somewhat realistic way (not everything).

For those who haven't seen it:

""In a future society, time-travel exists, but it's only available to those with the means to pay for it on the black market. When the mob wants to eliminate someone, it sends the target into the past, where a hit man known as a looper lies in wait to finish the job. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one such hired gun, and he does his job well -- until the day his bosses decide to ""close the loop"" and send Joe's future self (Bruce Willis) back in time to be killed.""

They are usually released just in advance of Oscar Seasons, late in the calendar year, so as to meet the minimum eligibility requirements for the awards and be fresh in the minds of Oscar voters.

Circle(2015) is an underrated movie,[removed],movies,1603844246,lonesome__,True,1,2,2020-10-27
Circle(2015) isn't a bad movie,"I recently watched this movie again and I actually enjoyed it more than I did four years ago.  The plot is quite simple: ""Fifty strangers facing execution have to pick one person among them to live"". 

The movie has pretty bad ratings on RT and similar websites, both from critics and audience. I don't think it's that bad though. The movie succeds at keeping the viewer curious and guessing where the plot will go. I came across a review saying it simplifies too much discussion about certain social issues but I don't think that's the case. Trying to take on different social issues in a movie likes this in dialogues that don't sound too artificial, ""fake deep"" or preachy is difficult, but *Circle* does a good job at making it realistic and scary, wheb you think how certain people would be treated in that situation.

It could've easily become repetitive and boring since we're stuck with these characters in this chamber for 1 hour and a half. But it doesn't. Even if doesn't have sharpest of scripts(although far from bad) the entertainment value of this project is still enough to keep me hooked. Also, the performances are mostly great and directing is nice. But the people and dialogue are the focus, technically there's not a lot to say about it. Very simple.



But anyway, at the end of the day it's not objectively good or bad.. people just perceive art in different ways. I'd definitely give this a positive review though lol

In The Cabin in the Woods (2011) The Chem Department is at fault for botching the ritual; just like in ‘98.,"In ‘98 the ritual was botched by the chem department; Amy Acker’s character (from the chem department) says it was not their fault but is unable to point to a different department.

In the film, the chem department Marty’s marijuana with the intention of making him into the stereotypical fool. Unfortunately, the weed does not knock him out. Acker has no explanation.

After Marty saves Dana and enters the facility, the workers scramble to salvage the ritual. Acker rushes on and says, “Clean-Up says the prep team missed one of the kid’s stashes. Whatever he’s been smoking has immunizing him to all of our shit.” Clearly indicting a different department to blame. Why would the chem department not factor in the effects of smoking weed on “their shit” while lacing a subject’s weed? Very sloppy.

It’s also notable that Marty appears to be a nervous wreck the whole time and is surprised at his own ability to dismember a zombie with a trowel or shot a supernatural entity in the head while running (past the elevators etc). It appears the Chem Department lacing has given action hero reflexes and the situation is a bit worse than him just being “immunized”

"The 'Burbs, 1989","Directed by Joe Dante (*The Howling*, *Piranha,*) and starring Tom Hanks and Carrie Fisher, among others, [*The 'Burbs*](https://youtu.be/pyRUijyrXr4) is a fantastic comedy with a serious horror side to it.

Joe Dante did with *'Burbs what he'd already proven he could do well with the Christmas classic *Gremlins* and its sequel - he made a light-headed comedy film peppered with scenes and sequences of horror, violence... and Leatherface.

This movie is over thirty years old now, and so I guess it may seem dated to some - but in my opinion, it never gets old.

The drowning/CPR sequence is almost unbearably tense. The scene where Bud descends into the abyss is terrifying. The relationship between Bud and Lindsey is really effective. I must say the CGI holds up really well considering the age of the film. The practical NTIs don’t hold up near as well, but it didn’t hurt the overall impact.

What’s your saddest slasher movie death?,"So I grew up with the Halloween franchise. I always loved 4 &amp; 5 because of Danielle Harris. She was great. The sweetest girl ever. Always rooting for her.

Im a sucker for Rob Zombie’s Halloween films. I like that he puts his own stamp on them and whatnot.

Annie’s death in Rob Zombie’s Halloween 2 was the one death to always make me feel uncomfortable and truly quite sad. Maybe it was the flashbacks to her kid self during that sequence or Brad Dourif’s reaction to when he discovers her body. It was heartbreaking. And she was great in jt.

What's your take on that one scene in Borat 2?,"First i would like to say that i absolutely loved the movie. I wouldn't say it was as funny as the first one but the comedy was replaced by more deeply disturbing social commentary.

Anyways, what is your opinion of the Rudy Giuliani scene? My take is that even though he didn't ''do anything'' it was pretty clear that he wanted to and was going to sleep with her. I think the discussion shouldn't be about ''What he physically did'' because the only reason he didn't do anything inappropriate is because SBC intervined before he could.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the discussion should more be something like ''Is it okay for Rudy Giuliani to have sex with someone clearly much younger than him. His intent was pretty obvious to me.

Suggestions for murder mystery character model,"Hello,

  We're doing a COViD-safe murder mystery party and I have to play a chauvinistic, eccentric, enigmatic wealthy male who hates not being the center of attention yet is looking to ""settle down"" and fit in with his neighbors. I travel a lot and have a lot of collectibles and get frustrated if I'm not the center of attention.

  Anyone have recommendations for a good character to model this off of? The hardest thing about this is being social butterfly that draws people's attention, so it's generally likeable, and who wants to be liked, yet also walks the line of being a chauvinist as my character card says.

  Thinking something like chris evans character from Knives Out but less combative, just as self-assured, and maybe a little more like John Lennon aesthetic",movies,1603853975,CuzImShiny,True,1,4,2020-10-27

The Empty Man much better than I expected.,"I have to say it feels like the studio gave up on properly marketing this movie, because the trailers do not do it justice at all. 

The movie has three distinct acts, each one paced beautifully (the movie is long but never dull). The shots and lighting are excellent. Solid performances from mostly little known actors. 

The movie has strong Lovecraftian elements that I will not spoil here. 

It really scared me. The plot deals with the nature of reality and knowledge of self, of identity. A bit anxiety inducing as well, to be honest. The middle (and longest) act is an increasingly disturbing investigation into the disappearance of a girl and a group of people with some very extreme beliefs. I got hints of True Detective (season 1) and In the Mouth of Madness, but it differs from those sources in very real ways. 

Currently 6.5 on IMDB which is not bad for a horror movie I suppose. I'd say it's my favorite horror movie of the year, over Midsommar even.

Furthermore, TV ratings don't go higher than MA, and MA-rated shows on the regular get away with content greater than R-rated films. So it's not like film ratings are in step with other media. 

I know damn well that the MPAA ratings are completely FUBAR, but besides that, is there any reason for it to still exist, except as a way for the big studios to stack the deck against indies?

"If you liked Thunder Road, watch - The Climb!","Just got home from the cinema from a back to back showing of the climb and pixie. Both so much fun (esp pixie, hilarious throughout) but anyway this movie will go underwatched and underappreciated no doubt so heres me mentioning it as it deserves. Weaker than Thunder road but still really good in its own right 

My quick review:-

This was just as surprising as i expected to be, unpredictable in the sense that you don't know where one thing will go from another. Gave me thunder road vibes, anyone who dug that will enjoy this. There are several sequences and all of them are (mostly) shot in one take, which is seriously impressive. The camerawork and cinematography were great. The acting was pretty excellent too (weaker at times), the first half was slightly superior to the second which is why this isn't a 4 for me. Darkly funny at times and an overall really good time. 

- 3.5/5.

How does Hollow Man look just so.. Good?,"First time I've seen it so it's via Amazon Prime on my Roku..

It's a super silky smooth upscale with incredible CGI that looks just... So real.. Was it remade for amazon or is this how it looked at the time? My missus says it was this good on release but I doubt as it's clearly far higher frame rate and animation resolution than anything else of the time.

Am I watching a true gem like Jurrasic Park or is this a sneaky upgrade? Either way I am not complaining as it is a very well made movie and as always...

What are your top 10 favourite films and why do you love them?,"I'll go first. Obviously my list is always changing based on how I'm feeling at the moment but the top 3 usually stay the same.

1. Rocco and His Brothers (1960) - My absolute favourite film from my absolute favourite director. Probably my pick for the best film ever made. I feel like this is basically the best of both worlds when it comes to Visconti. It's all the appreciation of beauty and the excess of his later work in this nice neo-realist package (especially cuz he was my favourite of the neo-realism filmmakers). It's just a beautiful film with the best characters I've ever seen, Anna Giradot is so good in this film.
2. The Long Goodbye (1973) - This is a perfect adaptation imo, it has all the spirit of Marlowe adapted for a new setting and it's very much an Altman movie as well as a Marlowe movie. I also love the aesthetic of the movie, it's grungy and gritty but the colour still has that candy vibrance. The story too, it's about a good man trying to make his way in an ammoral world but he ultimately does make his way and that's a very beautiful story in my opinion.
3. Cure (1997) - When Paul Schrader talks about transcendental style in movies Cure, for me, is the peak of that. At least since Bresson. It's this film that's been perfectly stripped down to tell a story, it's cold and clinical. It's just so carefully put together, the staging in every scene is unfairly good. Kurosawa pulls off a 5 minute long shot that you can't look away from and I usually dislike long takes. It's one of those films that stays in your head for a long time.
4. Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) - this is a huge comfort movie for me. I know a lot of people prefer Good, Bad, Ugly but for me, West is peak Leone and therefore peak cinema in general. It's a lot more mature and deeply sad compared to even GBU, cuz it is a death of the west film, but it never loses that element of fun that makes it such an easy watch. It's the film equivalent of being inside, under the covers, on a rainy day. 
5. Blow Up (1966) - This was 'balls-drop' film for me, it was the first film that made me realize the power the medium had. It's a story that could only really be told through film. Those cuts in the blow up scene that move the camera closer and closer to what Antonioni wants you look at, the final fade out. Those could only ever be done in this medium. It's a film that really made me want to be a filmmaker so I could fuck with reality in the same way.
6. Walkabout (1971)- this is film that's incredibly personal to me. There are a lot of things in it that are super ineffable, you just have to see it to understand and you'll have your own understanding of it thats completely different. Nicholas Roeg is one of few geniuses of the medium, who can just conduct a film like music. His movies are still the gold-standard for editing. The story itself is very minimalistic and stripped down, it's really a big story told in a small package.
7. Sid and Nancy (1986) - Best biopic of all time. This film is exhausting and loud, but actually it's a surprisingly delicate love story. It has my favourite shot in all of cinema, where Sid's dancing with those kids at the end and this cab comes in, and it's like this alien ship. It's a super punk movie from one of my favourite directors Alex Cox, his films always have this great energy to them, the kind where the film is teetering on the edge of actually being good . I love everything he's touched but Sid and Nancy is my absolute favourite.
8. Brief Encounter (1944) - This film is just incredibly cosy for me. The cinematography is gorgeous, which is typical for a David Lean film, it just has this warmth from the outset. I grew up in England and that station feels so familiar and inviting. It has the same feeling as Amarcord does for me. But the film itself is actually very bitter and sad, it's probably the best of all the unfulfilled love stories. Celia Johnson also gives a top 5 of all time performance in my opinion.
9. The Chaser (2008) - best directorial debut of all time. Hands down. This film is edited in the most slick way, it's like music. The best cat-and-mouse film I've ever seen, every moment has this highwire tension running through it. The chase scenes, which are director Na's specialty, are the best I've ever seen in a movie. If you haven't seen The Chaser, don't read anything else about it and just watch it. It's on Youtube for free.
10. Kwaidan (1960) - Kobayashi is another genius of cinema. He has such control and understanding of the camera. This film is his masterpiece, Harakiri and Human Condition 2 are great, great films but Kwaidan is his masterpiece. The colours in this film are incredible, they defy description. Go look up the trailer for this film and you'll get it. But the way this film is made is just masterful, every shot is as it should be. Everything the camera does is perfect, every movement of the actors is natural and perfect. It's like watching Mozart conduct without seeing Mozart conduct.",movies,1603675850,Gottigottigotti22,True,1,65,2020-10-25

The fact that the film's were only partly based on the games doesn't bother me to be honest

I do understand that this would make a lot of people unhappy

I just thought the first 3 films in particular were ridiculously entertaining, lots of action, fast paced and those small references to the games were cool

I like Milla Jovovich and thought she did a good job

I need to watch the 4th film again, to be honest I remember it being good just not as good as first 3

5th film was a bit ridiculous but still fun in many ways

On top of that japan, a country with a completely perfect record failed on the same year several glitches happened on the american team. Leaving me to believe someone was tampering with things. So the people running the operation, within the film are called ""the directors"" leading me to think, who would be ""the upstairs""? Wouldn't it be the studios in the metaphor? They would be the ones who make a stupid call and screw things up cuz they think that's what will work and the directors have to be the ones to try and make it work.

Dredd (2012) is in the 'John Wick' tier of pure fun 2010s action movies.,"This movie is an absolute fucking blast from minute 1. The world building, the simple but effective plot, the cheese, and the brutalism all together are peerless in the last decade. It may not have the extensive choreography of John Wick, but the soundtrack is fueled up and the cast is full of unique, storied characters.

Should I watch The Irishman in multiple sittings?,"3 hours and 30 minutes long. Considering the amount of schoolwork I have recently, I don’t have a lot of time to watch it in a sitting. I have also never watched a movie this long except for Return of the King which was fine as it was mainly action. 

I was reading a twitter post of someone who split it into 4 TV episodes but the replies got so angry, saying how it’ll completely break the mood and pacing. So I don’t know, should I watch it in multiple sittings? Does it affect the overall experience?

What movie nailed it's concept so well that no one's going to try to touch it again,"(...until the inevitable reboot/remake)

I'll throw Jurassic Park down as a prime example. It's going to be hard for anyone to throw down a humans vs dinosaur movie any time soon, with a chance of touching the classic.

First up, those only so many avenues you can use to set up the conceit. It's either time travel to the past, or ""we clone them from last DNA"" (feel free to think of more!).

All this would be up for grabs, but Jurassic Park got it close to perfect: not only do we have the ticket price of humans and dinosaurs - ""two species separated by 65 million years of evolution, suddenly thrown back into the mix together"" - but we have a morality tale, filled with character arcs, sprinkled with top of his game early 99s Spielberg, and founded on a great piece of literature by Michael Crichton.

The SFX were used sparingly enough to hold their value over time, and frankly Rexy is such an icon of cinema that it would be tough to do your own spin on a T-Rex without comparisons.

So that's my nomination for a film where the concept was nailed so well, it is going to be tough or almost impossible for a film to escape it's shadow.",movies,1603498102,smedsterwho,True,1,36,2020-10-23

In the year 1955, Doc Brown gets to see his future time machine as a fully realized, fully functional piece of hardware. This would be so valuable to him as it would allow him an invaluable look ahead on the project, even so much to say that he could possibly create the time machine that much faster than before, altering his timeline, as well as Marty's to some extent, setting different events in motion.

Clara (2018) is a little gem of a movie with a huge payoff for sci-fi fans,"My favourite sci-fi is probably Contact (1997) and although Clara isnt on the same level in terms of production value it follows the same approach. Its about exploring the universe with todays technologies in a hard sci-fi setting. The movie opens up with the Fermi paradox and you get an inside look how the science behind the hunt for habitable planets works. I should mention that the movie for todays standards is slow and the subplot is a romance. So if any of these are a turnoff its maybe not a good pick for you. Iam not a particular fan of romances myself but i think in this case the movie and its plot benefits from it. 

Clara is not entirely hard sci-fi but the core of the movie is logical and coherent with present-day science which i prefer so much more instead of the mass produced, dumbed-down, empty shells which are labeled sci-fi nowadays. I want less lasers, explosions and lens flares. Instead i want more thought-provoking ideas and philosophical concepts that dare to ask questions that will be on your mind long after the movie ended. That is exactly what Clara delivers. 

The movie is broad and tackles a multitude of themes. Besides the exploration of space it is also about love, loss, grief, the afterlife and god. If i had to point out anything negative about Clara it would be that it is biting off more than it can chew. That doesnt mean its superficial, quite the contrary, its just very ambitious - in a good way.

Towards the end of the movie the plot gets bolder and it turns from hard sci-fi into sci-fi fantasy. While this is of course detrimental for the plausibility it is also necessary for what the movie does best and that is giving the viewer a huge payoff. Clara is like christmas for any sci-fi fan. It accomplishes a satisfying conclusion where so many big productions previously failed. You can tell that the writer and director is a huge sci-fi fan himself. I had a smile on my face for the last 10 minutes of the movie.

Is Clara a flawless movie? No, not by any means. Does the movie tackle too many philosophical ideas at once? Yes. Does it get off the rails at the end? For sure. Is it absolutely beautiful while doing all these things and paying off? See for yourself!

Borat 2,"So I just watches Borat 2... a good film, not as good as the first in my opinion but I did laugh alot. 

My question relates to both Borat films... how does the privacy work? The majority of the people in the film are not actors..they genuinely believe they are helping a Kazakhstani reporter in their lives. 

Now in Borat 2, i noticed a couple blurred faces.. so i assume after they shot the scene, the producers asked the people of they were okay to show their face in the film to which they said no.. 

But there are some people that are openly racist/homophobic that i dont imagine would want their face shown knowing their comments would be on a film for millions to see.. and even in Borat 2, having the current attorney to Trump in THAT scene.. he definitely wouldnt want to be in the film..esp now hes in the media a lot due to this film...

So in most cases do the producers just not ask and show peoples faces without their consent and only ask certain people in certain scenes? How does the privacy thing work here?",movies,1603501325,Oakenshield-,True,1,13,2020-10-23

"Black Panther 2018: Mediocre Story, Shoehorned Identity Politics and Wrong Lessons on Diversity","I wrote previously that Black Panther(BP) was overall a good movie, though for me, it didn't live to the hype and ratings I heard from viewers, pundits and film critics.

Over time, however, I have since revised my opinion. And I've come to see this movie as a very problematic one. Right now there is a lot of 5 stars reviews and praises for BP, but years to decade from now, it will be remembered for no more than a cultural phenomenon.

Disagree? OK, here is a question. Race swap all the characters in BP from black to white, keeping everything else the same. Would BP still attract all the adulation and award nomination it did? NO.

I'll start by comparing BP with the first Thor film, after all the core premise of both films are the can be boiled down to - the prince of a powerful kingdom, imbued with superhuman powers on a quest to protect his people.

But unlike BP does with T'Challa, Thor presents a more developed Odinson, giving us a more personal film on the central character. In other words, Thor is more of a story of Odinson than Asgard while BP is more of story of Wakanda than T'Challa. 

We get to see Odinson as he grapples his differences with his father and brother, and come to terms with his exile and the new people in his life - Jane Foster and her family. In BP, T'Challa is quickly crowned and the rest of the film is a vibranium and fugitive hunt till Killmonger arrives. Thus, the depth of internal conflict seen in Odinson is lacking in T'Challa.

If you want to see T'Challa 's character done better as far as internal conflict goes, see Captain America: Civil War. 

Instead, BP writers opted to tell a story more about the black experience in diaspora, thereby casting it's main villain as a sympathetic character, probably more relatable than the hero. And a lot of people praise this aspect of the film for daring to 'draw our attention to racial injustice against blacks in the US.'

Of course, this is what I imply as 'shoehorned identity politics' in the title of this post. People, it is no longer 1960s or '70s. Conversations on racial injustice are rampant everywhere, from academia to the access media and government. We do not need another film in the 21st century to remind us of the menace of racism.

Killmonger worked as a villain when first introduced in the comics in 1973, in the immediate aftermath of Jim Crow, but not today when virtually all laws for institutionalized racism and discrimination have been repealed. And the grievances of Killmonger, like mass incarceration or police brutality against blacks have been disproven with full statistical data at this point.

With these said, the silver lining I thought with BP was it's success, which serve as indication that rather than seeking representation in largely white cast Hollywood films, blacks can proceed to direct &amp; produce their own predominantly black cast films to represent themselves as whites have been doing for themselves. And then forget lambasting movies as ""too white"" or not diverse enough.

But no, a lot of people learnt the wrong lessons from BP &amp; continue double downing for some form of diversity quota in casting, putting diverse cast above story telling and film maker's autonomy. Which just comes off as nosy, entitled &amp; ignorant.

There is no shortage of black representation in the media. Black Americans do produce their own films, so do blacks in Africa like Nollywood of Nigeria. But because these movies were not gaining the level of popularity as the ""whiter"" films, people began to complain. 

These people may be understandably bored of ""straight white faces"", and they had options, but they refused to watch anything outside the Big Five American studios. They refused. 

In conclusion, BP's story is not well done, it's attempt at racial politics is meh, and the people learnt the wrong lesson on diversity from it's success.",movies,1603504536,Kryptin,True,1,5,2020-10-23

Open Letter to Manny Coto,"I hope that program creator Manny Coto gets a chance to read this open discussion on Reddit or anybody that can point him towards this. Odyssey 5 has to be one of my top 20 series of all time. This series was one of the best time traveling shows I've seen in a long time, besides Travelers, which looked awfully familiar in concept to Odyssey 5. Physical time travel was impossible, but sending your conscious back, like code, was possible, genius!

I remembered watching the pilot episode of Odyssey 5 and being blown away (no pun intended) by what occurred and watching every episode with the space crew until the end. I was heartbroken to find out midway that Showtime canceled it before the story arc could be concluded. In the DVD commentary, Manny Coto along with Peter Weller, stated that he was going to have crack at the series again but wasn't sure when. Peter Weller stated on a meet &amp; greet, that filming Odyssey 5 was the best show he's ever been in.

You know what Manny? I'm sorry that you weren't able to go back into the series to finish completing your vision. But they are other mediums out there, such as books or graphic novels to finish your conclusion of the series. I just want to know what happened to Angela after the Cadre took her.

Quantum of Solace is not as bad as people make it out to be,"Its grown on me over time. When viewed as an epilogue of Casino Royale rather than a full fledged stand alone, its not bad. 

When I first saw it, I thought the whole plot hanging on water was dumb, but maybe not. Heck Michael Burry (from the big short) thinks water is the next big thing and that is what hes investing in. 

It moves along at a very quick pace, there is no filler. The bond girl's story (Montes) of losing her family and waiting for revenge fleshes out yet another Bond girl which is a nice change of pace from the other non Craig Bond movies. 

That General Medrano is one of the lowest vile villains in the series. The attempted rape scene is hard to watch. It was great to see agent Montes put him down. 

The action is fun, though feels a little too much like Bourne wannabe at times, but it fits with the Craig era. 

Mathis' death and his body being dumped in a dumpster felt almost like it foreshadows how Bond's life will end someday if he stays in the spy world. 

I thought Fields was a pointless character.

The one major gripe I have is the very end when we see Vesper's lover/boyfriend Yusuf - and now he has a canadian intelligence agent for a lover he's going to use.............the only problem is I don't buy it. The guy doesn't look like someone who could seduce someone like Vesper or that Canadian agent.

"How come even when a scene is already brilliantly performed in the first few takes at the highest level of Tony award worthy live theater stage acting, its shot over and over for literally the whole day even on a tight schedule? Sometimes even for whole days?","Inspired from learning a single episode of Charmed takes 8 days to film and one scene is shot multiple times even by the talented leads for something as simple as walking down the door steps while talking with each other.

I saw some of the now released footage of filming the scenes and god I learned to appreciate the professionalism of Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano, and later Rose McGowan! By the first few takes they done the scenes flawlessly as though they were rehearsing professional Tony class theater live!

Yet despite that, the footage released of behind the scenes show them doing a single 2 minute scene for ten minutes straight and thats not even 1% of the amount of time spent filming a simple 3 minute dinner conversation!

I also was watching footage of Gone With the Wind and the scene where Hattie is talking to Vivien out from a window took a whole day to film even though its less than 5 minutes and not important to the film in the grand scheme of things. Vivien and Hattie already shows professionalism that the first take was oscar worthy but they spent the whole day refilming the same line over and over.

Is there any reason why multiple shots of an already Shakespearian class of acting is needed for a single scene? I might if the schedule is so tight why spend the whole day filming a 1 minute scene? In some of these Charmed outtakes the director even praises the performance as top class by the 5th repeat filmed performance but still asks for more hours of the same scene acted over and over and accumulate an hour worth of footage of multiple performances of the single scene.

What is the reason for this?",movies,1603508987,EvaWolves,True,1,4,2020-10-23

Is the average quality of acting in theater much higher than in movies?,"Afterall most of the Oscar winners started in theater or do just as much live theater as they do in movies. Not to mention even in the debut roles in movies, many experienced theater actors (esp if they come from Broadway or England's theatre scene) are already praised in their first ever movie role such as Timothy Dalton's entrance in film in The Lion in the Winter.

Rebecca (2020 - Netflix) Reviews are in......,"....and they're **BRUTAL**

None of respected news outlets have given anything higher than 3* with most either 1.5 or 2*.

Rober Ebert: 1.5*
&gt; Nobody has a firm grasp on what exactly they are supposed to be playing. There's not a clear enough sense of collective suppression, desires unspoken, sexual/psychological torment so intense it leads to madness. Thomas brings it, but she seems like she's in a different movie.  

The Guardian: 2*
&gt;Overdressed and underpowered romantic thriller. Manderley itself has been Downtonised into a colossal stately home with an absurdly large staff. Lily James is the new Mrs de Winter and she has sweetness and charm resistant to condescension. But in this film, the problem is Max – who is transformed into an obvious hunk. Hammer has seven times Olivier’s body mass, and he does not have his cold English abruptness or his suicidal misery. Hammer just looks too candid and upfront.Armie Hammer is miscast as the troubled widower.

Vulture: 1*
&gt;Rebecca Is a Hollow, Turgid Retread.Poor, poor Armie Hammer. Who told him the lie that being white, tall, and rich-looking was enough to establish a career in Hollywood? Hammer has never excited me; both his choice of films and what he does with his appearances tends to bore, if they register at all. But Netflix’s Rebecca — the laborious Ben Wheatley adaptation of the Daphne du Maurier novel that was already straight-up bodied by Alfred Hitchcock and David O. Selznick in 1940 — brings his limitations as an actor, screen presence, and potential star into a harsh spotlight.

Slate: 

&gt;Hitchcock’s adaptation is a tough act to follow, and why Wheatley chose to do so is a bigger mystery than any plot point in Rebecca.That’s a tough act to follow, and why Wheatley chose to do so is a bigger mystery than any plot point in Rebecca. In Lily James and Armie Hammer, he has cast leads whose performances are dwarfed by Fontaine’s and Olivier’s. James, pillow-lipped and constitutionally ebullient, never manages to play a convincing mouse, and Hammer signifies his savoir faire by smoking cigarettes and dispensing clipped orders to underlings. He is far too callow and young—less than three years older than James—to suggest a tragic past.

Ouch. I was hoping to watch it but I now may pass.

Vox Lux? Does Anyone Else Love This Movie,[removed],movies,1603322261,SNC__94,True,1,2,2020-10-21
Let’s Talk About How Great Vox Lux Is,"Is there anyone who loves Vox Lux because I do. It’s one of those movies that were made for me. This movie just seeped into my head and has made permanent residence. If you don’t know what this movie is about then I’ll tell you. 

Vox Lux is a movie about Celeste, an average teenager until the shooting. Celeste survives a school shooting and her life is changed. During a memorial, she sings a songs that leads to her discovery. Immediately thrown into the spotlight as an up and coming artist. As an adult, Celeste is a massively successful pop artist at the cost of becoming volatile and  self destructive individual. 

The whole movie a voyeuristic dream where we’re watching these events unfold. There are no major conclusions, Celeste doesn’t make a vow to be better. She has a few hollow promises, but they’re said for appeasement. Her personal relationships are fragmented. Bears no responsibility for her choices. Celeste is so far away from the massacre that led to her rise to fame but not far enough. She’s not a remarkable talent yet she’s marketable. Also the pop music, as vapid as it is, was written by Sia. It’s a movie and soundtrack you can listen to a hundred times.",movies,1603322457,SNC__94,True,1,0,2020-10-21

CLOCKERS (1995) is a great film,"film was adapted from 'Clockers' by american author Richard Price.  Directed by Spike Lee.

this movie plays out like Spike Lee doing an episode of Law &amp; Order or CSI .  Hard nosed who dunnit although all the clues point to the hard working family man Isaiah Washington (very underrated actor) for another routine night shooting near Brooklyn Nelson Mandela Projects which serve as the main backdrop for our story.  As always Spike does a phenomenal job using the NY sights and sounds to tell his story as much as our characters.

Harvey Keitel (perfect choice, rumor has it Robert Deniro was set for the role but was busy filming Casino), John Tutturro (underused) are the homocide or homo-cide detectives assigned with the case. 

Strike (Mekhi Phifer) is he main character as he is dealing with his brothers incarceration, health issues (kind of over the top) affinity for trains (hates sports), his boss (Delroy Lindo, always great),

It's a good socio-economic viewpoint on how certain youth are burdened by circumstance to their environment.  All the varied characters are doing what they can to survive. No moral conclusion either as the beat goes on.  Spike usually has a unique voice in good trumping evil in his films.

More digestible than some of Spikes earlier work to a certain audience.  The cast is fantastic as well.",movies,1603322654,xela_sj,True,1,16,2020-10-21

today, the memory of a movie scene jumped in my mind: A grown up male, I think it is our protagonist, and a child, probably a girl, are sitting in some kind of american diner. The kid is slurping a milkshake, the guy is probably just sitting there on the other side of the table. Suddenly, the man pulls a gun, a revolver if I remember correctly, and shoots himself in the face. There is blood everywhere, but noone really reacts to the sudden suicide. A few seconds later we know, that this was just some kind of daydream.

This scene was relatively close to the end of the movie I am looking for and the movie shouldn't be older than 10-15 years.

Please help me out here, this scene was running through my mind for the entire day. It could be rather trivial, but my attempts to google this scene weren't close to be helpful.

The two greatest ideas I've ever had in film almost came to life... but both collapsed..,"Not sure where to go with this, but really just need to put it out there as it still eats at me. 

I've seen thousands and even owned thousands of movies (no, not just downloaded).  I spent my youth idolizing directors and can talk days about film.   The amount of thoughts and ideas I've studied are endless.  The point is, after 30 long years of film and it's dissection... I really only ever came up with two SOLID ideas that I will still swear to this day are great ideas.  They are not my very own ideas (nothing ever is), but shared (clearly) among others.  They are ideas that were shared among the greats of film and because of this,  it of course validates how great my ideas were... or as it may be, not? 

1. Neil Blomkamp should make an Alien Franchise film.  When I first saw Disrict9 in Cinema.. I left thinking to myself... holy moly this dude NEEDS to make an Alien film.  I love the way he makes things look... REAL!!!  Fast forward years later and I hear rumours... I see sketches.. I have wet dreams...  Then it all falls apart and looks like he never will.   
2. My first true love of film was Trainspotting.  Danny Boyle has a gift that I feel no one else has... The ability to make a film about anything ... and for everyone.  I suppose James Cameron owns the title for this (most money) but in my eyes, no one does it quite like Boyle.  I was growing bored of the Bond franchise and appreciated what Mendes was doing.. but still I really thought it needed a fresh take.  Alas, I dreamt of a Danny Boyle Bond.  The thought alone was enough to send me into a frenzy.  I still have no idea what it would be like, but holy moly would I line up to see it.  That of course also began to happen... and then tumbled into oblivion.  

I KNOW this is just a case of something I thought of that didn't happen blah blah blah... but I want to state these two ideas were my top ideas.. like I thought knowing these things made me smarter or something... then they began to happen.. and I began to be motivated and think I may actually have some creative juice talent... but then they collapsed and here I am writing to no one on reddit.   

So I guess I am here just to complain. there is no gain to be made.  I really wish these things happened, but instead I was teased and destroyed.  Please share in misery.",movies,1603205537,Skavis,True,1,10,2020-10-20

The (Unintended) Nixon Trilogy,"I just watched The Post (2017), All the Presidents Men (1976), and Frost/Nixon (2008), and they make an excellent unplanned trilogy. All of the movies are great on their own, but really shine when watched together. In my opinion, the movies also get steadily better. All the Presidents Men was my second favorite and Frost/Nixon was my favorite.

When watching the docudramas together, you start to catch some details that could be missed otherwise. Especially, how the same cast of characters is mentioned throughout the three movies. One of my most obvious takeaways is just how important Ben Bradlee is for the history of the United States. He was the main proponent of releasing the Pentagon Papers and the lead editor for the release of the Watergate stories. If Bradlee didn't exist, the world would probably have never known about either of these events (as an aside, his son is also the editor in the movie Spotlight (2015)).

In addition to being an important subject matter from a purely historical standpoint, the trilogy is also a ""fun"" contrast to our current political situation. I don't think its hyperbole to claim our situation today is a direct result of the events of Nixon's Presidency. 

Can you think of any other good docudrama trilogies? Other unintended trilogies?

TL;DR: If your looking for stuff to watch, I'd recommend watching The Post (2017), All the Presidents Men (1976), and Frost/Nixon (2008) as a trilogy. They work really well together to explain the Watergate scandal.",movies,1603207368,a_moniker,True,1,21,2020-10-20

Bone Tomahawk &amp; Brawl in Cell Block 99 [Mild Spoilers],"I did a double feature of these two films by S. Craig Zahler last night and just wanted to share a couple of my thoughts.

Interestingly I had expected to enjoy Brawl the most out of the two whereas I was a little iffy on whether Bone Tomahawk would really resonate with me but it turns out my expectations were reversed. I absolutely loved BT and while there were definitely aspects of Brawl that I enjoyed, there was just too much about it that didn't really gel with me so it ended up leaving a bad taste in my mouth. 

My low opinion is partly my own fault though as I think I went in with some preconceived notions about how the film was going to be and when it didn't match up to those notions I found myself disappointed. I was hoping for a gritty flick with some over the top violence which I got for sure but I guess I was hoping it would be a little more grounded which is why I was mostly enjoying the film up until Bradley is transferred to Redleaf. At that point the movie just becomes outlandish to the point that it almost feels like a comic book, the warden is comically evil and the guards are even wearing fucking villain henchman uniforms, it's like Arkham Asylum or something and ultimately it ended up taking me out of the film. I still enjoyed the action sequences and Vince Vaughan gives a fantastic performance towards the end but I really did find myself wishing it had all been a little less silly. Again that's probably my fault for going in with expectations like that, there's a chance I'd have enjoyed the film a lot more if I had gone into it either knowing what to expect or with no expectations at all. 

Bone Tomahawk though I'm glad to say really exceeded my expectations. I don't always mind a slow burn but I did fear that I might get a little bored in the long lead up to the climax. Luckily that wasn't the case, I found the pacing to be excellent at building a foreboding sense of dread as the party slowly makes their way to the Troglodytes. I'm a sucker for well written literary dialogue so even the slow moments were a treat, I found the main cast very likable with Kurt Russell and Mathew Fox especially giving stand out performances. The level of violence has been hyped up so much by so many people that I honestly found it to be quite tame (obviously *that* scene is still pretty fucking intense), I'm not great with gore so I geared myself up for the whole thing to be a lot worse than it actually was. That being said I loved the way the violence was shot, it felt very quick and real, it's never framed overly cinematically but instead it's happens as shockingly and suddenly as it probably feels for the characters. 

Overall though very impressed with Zahler's work even if I didn't fully enjoy both films, I'll definitely be checking out Dragged Across Concrete when I get the chance.

Interested to hear other people's thoughts, I've noticed online Brawl tends to get more praise whereas reception towards BT is a little more mixed which is interesting given my opposite experience.",movies,1603209285,Mr__Sampson,True,1,3,2020-10-20
Barbie as The Princess and The Pauper is a masterpiece,"First of all, 
[the musical numbers](https://youtu.be/wTPw0YeQs5A) are incredible. So much so that I remembered good portions of the songs around 15 years after I had last seen the movie. If you aren't into princess stuff AT LEAST listen to the villian song ""[How Could I Refuse](https://youtu.be/5otYUHbaJX8)."" 

The writing is really fun. There are lots of subtle jokes that fly over kid's heads, but make me crack up as an adult. 

The voice acting is great. It's almost better to listen to the whole movie without watching it so that you aren't distracting by the slightly janky 2004 3D models. 

The cinematography is actually pretty good for a kids movie. There are lots of interesting shots and angles that I can appreciate. 

The animation is surprisingly fun. You can tell that the animators had a blast having the characters spin around and do some dance moves. The characters are quite expressive in their movements, maybe not so much with the face though you can tell they tried. 

Overall, I adore this movie. The only thing dragging it down is the subplot that literally every Barbie movie has with the animal sidekicks. I hate those sidekicks with a passion. 

9/10 - one point deducted for animal sidekicks

Trying to remember name of this Korean movie,"This is a long shot but here goes.


I watched a Korean (I know for sure it was Asian and I'm 99% sure that it was Korean) movie on Netflix a few years ago and I cant seem to remember the name of it. Hoping somebody can help.


I don't remember much details, but I believe the protagonist was a younger boy, probably in his teens, and he was some sort of hitman or collector. I just remember he rode a motorcycle and the one scene I recall is that he goes to see some guy in a boxing gym, ends up beating the shit out of him and finishing him off with a flying knee to the face as he lays on the ring's ropes and breaking his neck. Basically the guys head is lying on the ropes, the kid is outside the ring and he jumps super high and knees his face.


I believe he has a sister in the movie and she plays a part as to why he's going around beating people up.

Terminator Dark Fate is frustrating,"I watched it and it's just ok. Action is just fine and the actors are well cast. I'll admit that it's the most interesting of the sequels post T2, but the handling of Dark Fate's story and ideas are frustrating. 

The idea of John Connor dying at the beginning is shocking as hell and I thought this would spring board the franchise into a new  direction... only to repeat the plot points of T1 and T2. The idea of a Terminator completing it's mission, gaining consciousness, and choosing to live like a human is an good evolution for Arnold to play, only for an excuse to repeat the role of T2, T3, and T Genesys. The idea of the future constantly in flux where humanity will be destroyed and a new savior will always defeat the machines is hopeful, but it doesn't dwell on the idea only to fall back on protecting the chosen one plot point. The setting of immigration and even a detention center is there (paralleling the future?), but doesn't really say much and is only window dressing. 

It's the most frustrating kind of scifi where you can see the ideas are good and interesting if explored well, but dashes it to hit action beats the audience expects. I like the cast a lot especially the newcomers with Gabriel Luna and Mackenzie David, there are some fresh ideas, and it's great seeing Arnold and Linda Hamilton on screen together again playing different roles or stages in their life.

"Plot holes in ""Terminator"" franchise?","I'm finally getting around to watching Terminator: Dark Fate and a couple of thoughts occurred to me:

1) In the first movie, it's established that non organic materials cannot go back in time. Kyle Reese and the T-800 both were able to travel in time because of the biological / organic components. Kyle because he's human and the T-800 because he's cybernetic / a cyborg and has organic elements around the robotic skeleton. This is why neither could bring weapons from the future or even clothing.

But, in Terminator 2, we get the T-1000... the ""liquid metal"" terminator. The key word there being metal. It does not have an organic component, so why is it able to travel back in time? One could make an argument that the terminators of Genysis (T-3000 ""John Conner"") and Dark Fate (the Rev-9) are on different timelines and thus likely have different time travel methods, making that restriction no longer valid, but that doesn't excuse T-2. (If I'm forgetting something from T-2 that explains this, please remind me)

&amp;#x200B;

2) Part of the Dark Fate storyline essentially retcons everything after T-2. While this is a typical plot/story piece in each movie (Judgement day changes as a result of what happens in an earlier set Terminator movie), the change in Dark Fate leads to a big flaw in the movie's logic. If Skynet was taken out of existence at the end of T-2, which Dark Fate makes clear is the case since ""Legion"" is the new evil AI and ""Karl"" knows that Skynet no longer exists, then there was no Skynet to create and send ""Karl"" back to 1998 as that 1998 is the new ""no Judgement day"" timeline. If the Skynet of T-2 sent another Terminator to 1998, then it would have gone to the T-2 timeline's 1998 where Sarah and John had not wiped the entirety of the AI from existence.",movies,1602977117,HyruleBalverine,True,1,20,2020-10-17
What makes a hammy performance a GOOD hammy performance?,"Actors who chew the scenery and go HUGE for comedic effect are often grating.    Jim Carry, Chris Farley, Mr Bean - definitely gifted - but not everyone enjoys those performaces.

But  Christopher Lloyd in Back to the Future is universally beloved.   Or Alan Rickman in Robin Hood. About half the cast of The Princess Bride. Madeline Kahn in anything.   Is it there something about those performances that they pull off that most actors can't -how do they do it?  Or is it good writing?  Or is it all just camp?

I am not getting into hammy drama (Al Pacino, Nic Cage). I think that's  separate.

Foxcatcher is a powerful movie.,"Spoilers ahead.

Right off the bat, you feel sympathy for this guy, Mark Schultz. He’s so emotionless, so drained. Whenever he stretches or exercises, his face is blank. Whenever he eats, his face is blank. You can’t help but feel for him.

I thought Channing Tatum delivered a career-best performance. His rare emotional breakouts in the movie felt so raw because they’re so very sudden and you don’t know when he’ll break. Steve Carell gave an amazing performance as John du Pont, the guy who takes Mark, and his brother Dave, played by Mark Ruffalo, under his wing. Every scene with him was so unsettling and creepy. He really captured the way the real John du Pont behaved and spoke.

Mark Ruffalo. He was excellent in this movie as well. Whenever you see him on screen, he’s just such a bright light in the midst of whatever horrible situation the characters may be in. He’s always reassuring Mark, trying to help in every way possible, being a great brother. It’s a shame about what happened to him at the end.

Bennett Miller’s directing is great, too. He brought something to this movie that was totally different from Moneyball, another great film. I thought he captured the intense ambiance of every scene very well.

A wonderful movie with fantastic directing and top-notch acting. I thought this movie was robbed at the Oscars in 2015. It’s great that Mark and Steve were nominated, but Channing should have been too, in my opinion. He’s not in many “Oscar-worthy” type films, but this one... he went all in.

The Scream films are incredibly prescient for the violence in our society that would come about years after their release. (Spoilers),"This October I decided to watch the original Scream trilogy as I had never actually sat down and watched them. I grew up when these films were released and I was in middle school. I remember hearing the basic plot of the series. 

But I do recall when it was released in 1996 there was controversy about middle class white kids going around murdering their classmates and teachers. To some it actually really seemed like a farfetched and unrealistic idea. Prior to Scream most killers were older and even real life serial killers tended to be in their mid-20s to 30s. Yet in 1999 you have the Columbine shooting where middle class white kids go and kill their classmates and teachers. 

Then look at Scream 2. The film starts with a double murder in a movie theater, where the killer mimics the villain of a film. Then in 2012 we have the Aurora shooting where the killer dresses up like/inspired by a character from the previous film. 

Then we have Scream 3 which deals with a Hollywood producer who abused and raped actresses. A major part of the plot is exposing this abuse and giving that producer his comeuppance. And I don't think it is a coincidence that Harvey Weinstein himself was a producer of the Scream movies. Cut to just a few years back when the metoo movement blows up and all of these Weinstein types are called out and prosecuted. I can't help but feel like Scream 3 was Craven calling out Weinstein for his actions, as apparently his conduct was an ""open secret"" in Hollywood.

And don't get me wrong I'm not saying the Scream films were the inspiration for any of these events. I just find it weird or even kind of haunting that they were able to pick up on something in the zeitgeist that would eventually lead to these events. I'd also say that it's hard to find other horror series that really tapped into future events like this. Halloween and Friday the 13th never felt like there was ever any reflection of that in real life the way that ideas from Scream seem to have. 

I dunno am I crazy thinking like this or is there something else there?

TL;DR: The first 3 Scream movies predicted middle class white kids killing their classmates and teachers like with Columbine, Scream 2 predicts murders in a movie theater with the killer inspired by a character from the film like the Aurora shooting. And Scream 3 was blatantly calling out Harvey Weinstein's abuse of actresses 17 years before the metoo movement. It's just kind of strange how reality eventually reflected the ideas presented in these movies.",movies,1602981548,TheZGok,True,1,3,2020-10-17

There isn’t a scene Keaton is in that he doesn’t absolutely steal. It’s a singular defining role with no direct parallel.

Cabin in the Wood - Sociological Commentary on Horror &lt;Spoilers&gt;,"I've wanted to do [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsIilFNNmkY) for a while and I hope I don't rush it because this is not only my favorite horror films (second to the 1990 remake of Night of the Living Dead) but one of my favorite films. I was blessed with friends who dragged me to the theater to see this with no idea what I was getting into, and I still cherish it as a re-watchable horror flick.

For me what I love about this movie is its ability to not only deconstruct the genre, but to also be the epitome of said genre; the scene when Jules and Curt go out and their murder is directed is perfect horror atmosphere. Even the film grain when the Buckners appear in the background of the control room after the first death is spot on. For those having seen it the film is an inescapable homage to numerous horror franchises which it executes with little subtlety e.g. the pan shot when we first see the cabin is a clear allusion to Evil Dead. Cabin in the Woods achieves by translucent foreshadowing a meta commentary that seeks to transcend the film reaching right out to the viewer.

The sociological commentary of Joseph Campbell is ever present, as from the outset when it is established what would typically be the meatheaded football jock is a sociology major, commenting intelligently to the movie's protagonist as to what course material would be of value. There is a clear deconstruction as part of the plot of a ritual sacrifice narrative which parallels commentary of the slasher genre. Arguably the slasher genre started with Pscyho, but came to its more modern and mass produced fruition with Halloween from which many of the tropes originate. The typical psycho-sexual commentary is the knife as penis penetrating the transgressors. In the film the survivor is the ""virgin""as vessel of purity which is optional within the horror mythos. The movie effectively subverts these tropes and then re-introduces them with more plausible explanations. It's the horror equivalent of ouroboros.

Plainly the horror genre plays to our puerile nature, particularly historically in the late 70s and early 80s it sells us sex, drugs, youth, and graphic murder with a moral twist. But, what if any, moral commentary is one to make of this? What is the archetype of this legend? This again is why I love the film because it exalts Clive Barker's Hellraiser as messenger, as evident with the character of Sawhead. What Hellraiser intoned, and I think few may have realized, was the cautionary tale of the horror genre. Hellraiser made as part of its mythos the drive of curiosity that killed the proverbial cat. That essentially these stories were a lesson in cautioning against the void; the vast unknown which consumed those too foolish or naive to head the warnings (harbingers). That is why the language of the movie requires the choice of the destructor and the choice to transgress. They know what not to do, but they do it anyway. What I think Hellraiser also understood about its audience was they live vicariously through the victims, that they themselves undertook the journey of discovery, despite knowing in advance the horrors that await them. 

But Cabin in the Woods moves beyond the narrow commentary of Hellraiser, as within the [mythos of Campbell](https://billmoyers.com/content/ep-4-joseph-campbell-and-the-power-of-myth-sacrifice-and-bliss-audio/) one finds the common cultural archetype of sacrifice; in his accounting of the indigenous people of New Guinea he tells of a copulatory act culminating in the sacrifice by a society of two youths. While we, the viewers, follow along as far as we dare with the innocent victims of these tales, we're also far too willing to let them suffer the agony of our shared sin. We'll watch their youthful indiscretions, their advance against every warning that says turn back, and when the dark moment arises we'll shriek in terror and proclaim, [""them, not us!""](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/4ffa116a-ddda-4796-8ba5-3e532fb97061) If one is to present a trophy or sacrifice on offer it must be one of value which is why those typically sacrificed are young and beautiful. Even in biblical canon, say the story of Cain and Abe, the plot hinges on the quality of sacrifice on offer.

But I also love the extended meta commentary that the gods who demand the sacrifice of the characters are stand-ins for the viewers. That there is in reality no otherworldly power; we're not butchering teenagers to stop pestilence, or famine, but rather we carry these impulses to probe the unknown and create suffering of the best of us and most innocent for our own benefit. That we might like to see others fall flat on their face for our own aggrandizement and to soothe our insecurities. It makes it all the more fitting and humorous the anti-hero is the stoner whose pervasive paranoia permits him to figure it out. It falls by someone who is outside of social norms.",movies,1602987034,louieanderson,True,1,2,2020-10-17

What’s the most Tarantino movie that doesn’t involve Quentin Tarantino?,"Imitation is the purest form of flattery, sure. Quentin Tarantino has pretty much made an art of homage. After the success of Reservoir Dogs there were a lot of filmmakers trying to capitalize on that success. Mirimax as a studio seemed to capitalize on this (Soderbergh, Smith, Rodriguez, Van Sant). 

I’ve seen movies that try and use the Tarantino formula like Poolhall Junkies, Suicide Kings, Boondock Saints, 2 Days in the Valley, Very Bad Things, Swingers, the list goes on. I enjoyed all of those movies, just like I really enjoyed Go. 

If there’s one movie that was going for that Pulp Fiction vibe it’s this. Trunk shots, pop culture, block dialogue, Breckin Meyer as a discount Drexl, nonlinear format, even Sarah Polley looks like Uma Thurman.

"[Kingsmen 3: The Golden Service] Harry Hart turns ""villain""","TL;DR: The Lepidopterist is the *perfect* name for a ""colorfull"" megalomaniac who's trying to save the world via villainy. 

I've allways had a nagging feeling that Colin Firth's Harry Hart is destined to become a villain. Like Valentine and Poppy, Hart will break. 

Why do I think this? Let's start simple:

1) [""I always felt that the old Bond films were only as good as the villain. As a child, I rather fancied a future as a colorful megalomaniac.""](https://youtu.be/QrC2LXR5Pzw)

Now you could take it as face value veiled metaphor in their cat and mouse game. A game recognize game moment. Though when you look at it from a character angle, it is rather apparent that Galahad is not lying here. Look at the giddy nature in which they both talk about the subject. Almost lost in a moment of childhood nostalgia. Neither man is lying. So if Valentine tried to save the world like his younger self wanted, then it stands to reason that Harry has that childhood dream himself. 

Harry even has a flair for the dramatic already. ""Manners maketh man"" is all about him causing a dignified scene to teach a lesson to all watching. In the Freebird church scene, you can see it BEFORE he starts fighting because of Valentine's machine.

""I'm a Catholic whore, currently enjoying congress out of wedlock with my black Jewish boyfriend who works at a military abortion clinic. So hail Satan, and have a lovely day, madam.""

Feels like a simple ""I'm going to the bathroom"" or ""I'm hot and need to breath outside for moment"" would have sufficed and gotten him out of there without hassle from the crazy Baptist and he KNEW that but didn't care. Arthur implies this subversiveness in their conversations with him about choosing candidates. Then there's the *way* in which he kills everyone there. Not just defense or trying to kill quickly but lots of slow, painful, and fucked up deaths. The killing is Valentine but the style is ALL Harry. It's part of the reasons he's disgusted. Not the enjoyment, but the ease with which he turned so gleefully. That slow motion fade in smile in the middle is proof of this. Harry *wanted* to punish those people the same way Valentine did. That's proven by what he says at the start. (Don't blame him either, just character commenting. Fuck those people.) Part of me thinks the Freebird is playing in *HIS* head. He's a bird freed by blood. 

2) [The Lepidopterist](https://youtu.be/1dvV6R6N8xU)  I know the clip is from Venture Bros but it's meant to show how two ""good guys"" became bad. Kinda the perfect coincidence. But I digress... it was a shameless plug to #SavetheVentureBros. 😎😙😍

[The hobbyist collecting of insects, fauna/flora, and what-have-yous](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCollector) has looooong been a trope of ""colorful megalomaniacs"". Then there's the added bonus that The Lepidopterist sounds like the *perfect* name for a Bond villain. 

[Butterflies even symbolize death and rebirth and the violence inherent in transforming something for the better.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButterflyOfDeathAndRebirth)

Is Harry's butterflies a set-up foreshadowing to his coming transformation from ""hero"" to ""villain""?

&gt;""I doubt whether I'd work for anyone who drowns their employees. I want to go home. I want my butterfly collection. I want to see Mother.""

3) As we know, all the best villains are ones we sympathize with and understand WHY they do what they do. Valentine was trying to solve over-population and save what he could of the species so it wouldn't happen again. Poppy wanted drugs to be legal, partially for vanity reasons but mainly for anger at global government hypocrisies (the same governments which had their heads blown up for trying to kill humanity for their own gain). Wouldn't it fit perfectly for Harry Hart to have seen the horrors inflicted by the world governments and the corruption of not only Statesmen, but his beloved Kingsmen themselves, and say ""No more."" What's he gonna feel when he finds out Arthur sold the Kingsmen's soul and got him killed? How long has the ""shoot the dog"" exercise been in practice? Why is trying to drown someone thought of as a reasonable way to help them? Does the rot go to the core? All things any reasonable person would ask after being shot for an organization that was just blown up by a drug dealer.

&gt;""When I was shot, can you guess what the last thing was that flashed through my mind? It was absolutely nothing. I had no ties. No bittersweet memories. I was leaving nothing behind. Never experienced companionship, never been in love. And in that moment, all I felt was loneliness and regret.""

Who's to say what he would do or the methods he would take, but villains are merely people casting shadows in the way of the light. 

4) I put this last because it's more pun than the others and because I only realized it while writing their names out loud. Valentine. Poppy. Hart. A valentine is love, poppies symbolize death, and a heart combines both (a Hart is also the name for an adult male deer over the age of five but I'm not British enough to understand what the fuck that has to do with anything.) There's also Richmond Valentine/Rich Man Love (Rich dude saving the world). Poppy Adams/ Poppy of the Earth (Death of the World). And finally Harry Hart/Harry Heart. An attacking heart. Yeah, that's the old definition of ""harry"". To harass. (Or Power Ruler of the Five Year Old Male Deer. This isn't an exact science 🙃 ). Honestly, as I write these out, the puns become the hardest piece of proof for me. Brits love a good wordplay foreshadowing. 

&gt;""... this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."" 

AND what else do they have in common? They're all things associated with the color red. And what's red? 

BLOOD.

Sorry, couldn't resist the touch of drama. 

P.S. I know it's not really related but I also subscribe to [the Poppy is a former Statesmen theory as well.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/72dzdl/kingsman_poppy_is_a_former_statesman/) Making this an even more thematic connection.

What are the best english-talking movie YouTube channels ?,"Hi,

I'm french and I love a lot of movie youtubers but all the one I know are french and I have already tried them all.

As my level in english gets better, I think I can now start to search for good english-speaking movie youtubers, but it's very difficult to find good recommendations as youtube algorithm only recommend me french videos. So I'm asking here **what are your favorite movie-talking shows on youtube.**

I absolutely love a french youtuber who is building his whole universe and story, with a lot of acting before and after analysing a movie. His name is Karim Debbache and if you understand french you can try it's awesome [https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3lnp8j](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3lnp8j) . We also have The Coroner, who talks about important deaths in movies [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeah3nqu\_v6KfpXrCzEARQw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeah3nqu_v6KfpXrCzEARQw) .

So if possible, **I would like something similar that also does small acting scenes along with talking of movies**. It can be funny or not at all, I just want something that tries to do a bit more than just talking directly to the camera.

What should I try ?

Thanks in advance for your recommandations and have a good day !",movies,1602801574,LeVraiRoiDHyrule,True,1,12,2020-10-15

How patient should you be with a movie?,"At what time during a movie should you stop watching the movie and say, ""This movie is not for me?"". Or should you even do that at all? I know there are some great movies that if people are patient and watch it all the way through, they'll see some great second and third acts. La La Land kind of dragged in the beginning, but I watched it all the way through and it picked up quickly. I know The Godfather and 2001: A Space Odyssey are lauded as great movies, but some people also call them slow and boring. I'm sure many people have stopped watching those movies at some point during its run time. For me, I think you should watch a movie all the way through in order to accurately review it.

The Director's Cut of Little Shop of Horrors doesn't really work. (Spoilers),"So anyone familiar enough with Little Shop of Horrors (1986) probably knows that the ending was drastically changed after test screenings. Originally, Audrey died and asked to be fed to the plant and then Audrey II ate Seymour and destroyed America. This was more in keeping with the off Broadway play but test audiences hated it and a quick new ending was made where Seymour kills Audrey II and they live happily ever after. 

Frank Oz said that the reason audiences wouldn't go for it was because there was no curtain call to remind you the actors are all right. I think that explains part if it, there is certainly more emotional distance in a play because you know these things are going to occur again every performance. Moreover, the original play is actually a lot more cynical and ironic than the movie. You're not really supposed to sympathize with any of the characters. You're supposed to be laughing at them and appreciating the kitschy 50's throwback aesthetic. But in the movie, you do care about Seymour and Audrey, they're played pretty straight and frankly it's kind of shitty to be so mean spirited about poor people right?

So then we get to the ending or rather close to the ending because Audrey dies with about twenty minutes of movie left and who gives a shit about what happens after that? *Mean, Green Mother* comes  **after** Audrey dies and there's no dramatic tension for that or anything else that happens. There's about fifteen minutes of disaster movie destruction and it's fun to look at but there are no stakes to any of it. All the characters are dead already. Fifteen minutes is a long time to have no stakes in a movie.  Just as an example, (Spoilers for **Return of the Living Dead)**

&amp;#x200B;

**Return of the Living Dead** also ends with the main characters all dying and the world about to come to an end but that movie ends immediately once we know the main character is going to die because guess what? That's why we watch movies. Return of the Living Dead is also a cynical movie but it understands how stories work in a way that Frank Oz apparently doesn't.",movies,1602804680,Unleashtheducks,True,1,9,2020-10-15

Non-horror/thriller/suspense etc. Plot Twists,"Everyone loves a good plot twist, amiright? But it's usually the ones that come from the movies of the aforementioned genres. The Spookies, if you will. 

But what are some good plot twists that come from *outside* the norm of the Spookies?

One of the first that comes to my mind, (probably cause I just watched this movie a few days ago) is from the movie *Yesterday*. After the audience finds out that the main character Jack is actually *not* the one and only human on earth who knows of the Beatles. In fact, there are actually two other people who seem to also be aware of the band's existence, and after watching them basically stalk Jack, we're lead to believe for a good while that the strangers are scheming to expose our guy as the absolute fraud that he is in front of the entire world. Because how fucking dare he take full credit of the most precious music in all existence which he had a whole lotta NOTHIN to do with?!

And then, just as Jack is about to play his equivalent of the Rooftop Concert, the Beatles' final live performance. But just before taking stage, he learns of the stalker's arrival. And they want to speak with him. Now. Jack invites them in, humbley prepping himself for the massive repercussions he's been anxiously anticipating (but also secretly hoping for as the guilt of his omission just keeps growing deeper and stronger).

The moment has finally arrived. The stalkers introduce themselves, Beatles memorabilia in hand - eeek! - But wait a minute. They're... friendly? Ok, that's not what I expected. And now they're... *thanking him*?? REALLY not what I expected... Ooohhmygods, I think I've got it! Of coooouurse they're not angry and out to ruin this guy's life... HE GAVE BACK THE WORLD THE GIFT OF THE BEATLES!!! Fucking DDUUHHHHHH! 

In a world wiped totally clean of *THE* most important and incredible thing that has ever happened and *WILL* ever happened to music. A world that's been left so miserably void of such treasure. OF COURSE you would be beyyonnd grateful to one of only TWO other souls, minus your own, that was able to successfully usher THE FUCKING BEATLES back into BILLIONS of lives again! He, is our musical Messiah. And He shall be rightfully worshipped, as the Makers were. 

And during that final montage, we see the two ""stalkers"" dancing together on the rooftop, having an absolute ball in their full Stg. Pepper's garb. Just *baasking* in their newly revived Beatles delight - made me wail like a fuckin baby 😅🥰

tl;dr In *Yesterday* when we find out there's actually two other people other than Jack who remember the Beatles, making them the only 3 on earth. They seem to be planning on exposing Jack for stealing credit that belongs to the band. And when they finally get that chance, we learn that all they've actually wanted was to thank him for bringing the Beatles back to life with his natural talent, which is something they both lacked.",movies,1602810875,BuffyBoltonVampFlayr,True,1,5,2020-10-15

What was the main inspiration for Benjamin Button in his life? What psychological issues did he went through? What was his life’s purpose?,"I have those questions for psychology for the movie, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. To be honest, I think these are pretty subjective questions, but can you help me anyway just to be sure. 

I think his purpose was to make others realize that all of us have different lives and problems but at the end of the day we are all human and imperfect. No matter how much we change physically our personalities are engraved as you saw by how he knew who Daisy was even as a baby and he liked the same books. We all end the same way so we should be kind to others and each other’s too. Accept who we are and the challenges that life has given us.

Then, psychological issues I would have to see part of the movie again, but some include fitting in, realizing you have to sacrifice yourself for others, forgiveness (to the father and to daisy when she treated him wrong in NY), morality, etc.

His main inspiration is difficult I think it’s between three. When he left to work in the boat, being with Daisy around 49 years, his daughter being born. I wouldn’t know what to choose.

Two movies that I can't remember its title,"I need some aid with these two movies

1) Probably from late 80s or 90s It's about a middle age man (I always think in Harrison Ford) that gets involved in a crime (like Harrison Ford) but he is innocent. I think he don't run away or fight, is more a social thriller and the key point (at the end) is when he discover a close friend of him was guilty, and he discover it when, at the beggining of the movie, he left the cars of his car and the friend ""full the deposit""

2) Something like a utopic perfect world (I thought its title was brave new world but not) that has everything controlled and when people die, a rulette is spinned and depending the result a second chance could be offered, but the trame is that all is a lie (as usual)

What Horror Films Are You Marathoning for Halloween October?,"I tend to use this time to mostly catch up on horror movies I haven't seen rather than watching the same classics over and over again. So far this month, I've seen:

**Frailty--creepy thriller**

**Invasion of the Body Snatchers--very effectively disturbing and unique**

**Dark Water (original)--classic atmospheric Japanese horror**

**The Haunting of Hill House--nice blend of horror and family drama. Using ghosts as metaphors for psychological unraveling always scared me more than actual supernatural stuff; that's why Hereditary was so effective for most of the duration**

**Reanimator--more fun and unique than scary**

**Stir of Echoes--just okay. Mostly dug Kevin Bacon's performance.**

**Identity--good stuff. Suspenseful and has a very memorable twist.**

I feel like I'm missing something, but yeah, I'm deciding between The Human Centipede and A Tale of Two Sisters for my next one.

All the movies I've watched during the pandemic (this will be a long list so be aware...),"\- Memories of Murder (Korean, Crime, Drama). Started watching some Bong Joon- ho movies after Parasite, and this one to me, is way better. Based on the case of a real serial killer.

\- The Host (Korean, Suspense, Action, Monster). This one has to be my 2nd fav. Bong Joon- ho film, it's so good and weirdly funny when it shouldn't be.

\- Knives Out (Crime, Mystery). Really good, enjoyed the hell out of it, not as typical as you could think it is.

\- My Neighbor Totoro (Anime, Fantasy). One of the most wholesome shit I've seen in a while.

\- Speed Racer (Racing, Action, Anime style). I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW UNDERRATED THIS ONE IS, SOOO GOOD.

\- Zodiac (Crime, Mystery). Good, it drags in some parts, but still good.

\- The Others (Thriller, Mystery). Holy shit, this movie, be prepared for a good plot twist.

\- The Prestige (Mystery, Drama). This one has to be my fav. Nolan film by far, amazing.

\- The Village (Mystery, Drama) . Good enough to enjoy it, nice plot twist too.

\- Steel Rain (Korean, Action). Meh, not great, not bad; enjoyable to some extent.

\- Click (Comedy). Really liked this one, Adam Sandler's bests for sure.

\- The Brotherhood of War (Korean, War, Historical). The one that made me cry the most, sooo goood man.

\- 1987: When the Day Comes (Korean, Drama, Historical). This one made me cry too at the end; based on some real events that showed Korea's corruption during those years.

\- Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (Comedy, Thriller). Meh, it was okay. I know there's a lot of people who liked it, but it was not for me, srry not srry.

\- Confession of Murder (Korean, Action, Thriller). Enjoyable, don't expect it to be one of the best films out there, just watch it to have a good time.

\- Arrival (Psy- fi, Suspense). This one is really good, that plot twist bro, chills.

\- Spider Man Into the Spider Verse (Animation, Marvel, Action). THE ANIMATION THO; but overall what a Spider Man movie should be like.

\- Prisoners (Thriller, Drama, Crime). Holy moly guys, this one is rough, it's really good, but rough.

\- Phonebooth (Suspense). Enjoyable, again don't expect it to be the greatest, but really enjoyable.

\- Snowpiercer (Action, Thriller). HOLY SHIT GUYS, my fav. Bong Joon- ho film, and you have Chris Evans as the main character, really a MUST watch.

\- Clue (Crime, Comedy). What a classic man, what took me so long to watch it? It's funny af and the ENDING, man what a great film.

\- Baby Driver (Action, Crime). What a great soundtrack man, this movie be VIBING BRO, it feels smooth and clean.

\- The Princess Bride (Fantasy, Comedy). WHAT THE FUCK TOOK ME SO LONG TO WATCH THIS? 10/10, no doubt, I laughed during most of this film and don't even get me started with Iñigo.

\- The Illusionist (Drama, Mystery). Watched it because people were saying it's better than The Prestige, altough to me, that's not true; still a good film with a nice mystery involved.

\- The Edge of Tomorrow (Action, Scy- fi). Really good, holy shit, the action sequences are awesome and the whole plot is mind blowing.

\- Mulan (Remake, Disney). Shit, just shit. Don't even bother. ""Make a note of this: dishonor on you, dishonor on your cow, dis...""

\- Papillon (Drama, Historical, Prison). What a great movie man, I didn't expect half of what happened to... well, actually happen. That ending tho, really unexpected and laughed at how sudden it is.

\- Escape from Alcatraz (Prison, Historical, Suspense). Not as good as Papillon I'd say, but enjoyable. Clint Eastwood man, Clint Eastwood.

\- The Mist (Thriller, Psy- fi). BRUUH, THIS ONE WAS AWESOME. You'll hate almost every character I swear, but that ENDING MAN, THAT ENDING WAS AMAZING.

\- The Invisible Guest (Spanish, Crime, Suspense). This one guys.... this one right here has to have one of the best climax's I've seen in a long time.",movies,1602629415,TheRealYimLife,True,1,30,2020-10-13

I personally feel that Citizen Kane is a much better movie than The Godfather.,"Even though it constantly is ranked best film of all time, the general consensus at least from Flickchart and the average movie watcher is that it is overrated and boring while The Godfather is a timeless classic. Rewatching the Godfather recently I noticed some cracks. Even though Michael is the main character he isn't essential to the main conflict for large parts of the movie. His marriage in Italy happens really quickly and while that wasn't meant to be a huge plot point it felt unnecessary, she is only in the movie to get naked and then die. Sure it motivates Michael even more but why does he need more motivation, they tried to kill his dad, killed is brother and one of the conspirers Carlo repeatedly beats the shit out of his pregnant sister after Vito paid for an excessively expensive wedding. Charles Foster Kanes decay is the central focus of the movie and I am always drawn to the screen, he is a more multifaceted and interesting character than anyone in the Godfather. Santino, Barzini, Tattaglia, Tom Hagen, Kay and even Carlo don't feel terribly complex, it's a great story but I can't help but think it's status as the best makes me all the more critical of it because generally people will say it's superior to Citizen Kane and any other movie. Vito Corelone is an iconic character but I don't think he is nearly as interesting as Kane neither is Michael. I personally preferred Taxi Driver, Apocalypse Now, and The Lighthouse to The Godfather as well, just my two cents.",movies,1602630825,Chazz141414,True,1,27,2020-10-13

Do you have a favorite voiceover performance?,"I’m watching the Royal Tenenbaums for the 10th time at least. After Alec Baldwin’s first line, I was immediately embarrassed that I didn’t associate him with the movie more. I mean, I’m not the biggest fan of his but I have seen every episode of 30 Rock and various movies of his. There’s no mistaking that voice. I am more embarrassed than when I first watched *Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse* and was vexed as to who the black and white Spider-Man was (Nic Cage!). I have to say this is my favorite voice over performance even if it was effortless work for Baldwin and his husky voice. Maybe just because of the things he’s narrating.

My take on fixing The Rental (2020). [Spoilers],"I'm going to assume you have watched the movie so here's my take on how it could have worked.

**Scrap the horror parts. Make it a thriller.**

The movie could have worked as a thriller. No faceless mysterious killer. Just the four main characters and the housekeeper (Taylor) who rents the place for his brother. The four main characters (Charlie, Michelle, Mina and Josh) do a wonderful job at wrecking their own lives, no need to add a killer to the mix. Keep everything else in, except remove the stalker killer. The camera they find in the shower, the owner of the house, the brother installed them. That's why Taylor didn't know about them. Keep everything else unchanged. When Josh attacks Taylor in Minas defense, he accidentally kills him. The brother has the footage somewhere in the house and they have to find it after they get rid of Taylors body, just like in the original script. Mina and Charlie have their own motivations and Josh doesn't want his murder on record. Michelle finds the footage alone and later drives away, or doesn't. Maybe Charlie has to kill her without letting the others know, before she goes to the police? Maybe she goes to the police and thats how the movie ends? 

Now if they had worked with this instead of the faceless killer who just appears and kills everyone almost off screen, I would have enjoyed the movie more.",movies,1602631223,Perunamies,True,1,3,2020-10-13

Why isn't there a Hammer Films monster boxed set like there is for Universal's classics?,"A few years ago, [Universal put out a huge set of all their monster classics](https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Classic-Monsters-Complete-Collection/dp/B07DKY35N5/) (including everything except for, maddeningly, the original 1925 *Phantom of the Opera*).

In the late '50s and into the early '70s, Hammer Films struck a deal with Universal and made about twenty films or so, famously featuring Sir Christopher Lee, most often as Dracula, and Peter Cushing, usually as Dr. Frankenstein and Prof. Van Helsing.  However, trying to accumulate those films in one place is impossible.  

Why is there no single boxed set as there was with the Universal classics?  I know it's a niche market, but I would think it could be done fairly inexpensively and it would appeal to an avid fanbase.  Is it a rights thing?  Are some of the films not still in the same stable, as it were?",movies,1602636229,ety3rd,True,1,14,2020-10-13

They also de-aged Carrie Fisher in Rogue One.

While Scorsese makes a good point when he complains about ""amusement park movies"" taking over movie theatres, it's worth noting that a lot of the technology used by auteurs like him is developed for the big budget tentpoles.

Similarities between The Last Jedi (2017) and Kieślowski's Trois Couleurs: Rouge (1994) (possible influence?),"
Back in 2017, Rian mentioned a vast number of films that were influences/inspirations while writing and developing *The Last Jedi* (you can check all the cinematic sources here: https://archive.nerdist.com/star-wars-the-last-jedi-cinemati-references-guide-akira-kurosawa-jurassic-park-twin-peaks/). He never mentioned Kieślowski's *Trois Couleurs: Rouge* (1994) though, the third film of *Three Colors Trilogy* (1993-1994). 

There are substantial similarities and parallels between the two films. Since he never talked about it, I'm assuming that's just a coincidence, but here are all the similarities anyway:

* Both films feature a young beautiful girl (Valentine/Rey) who meet a cynical old man who is indifferent to everything (Kern/Luke).

* Both female protagonists try to give back to old cynical man something important they left behind (Rita/the lightsaber), but the old man refuses. 

* Both films feature a scene where the old protagonist (Kern/Luke) try to show to the female protagonist (Valentine/Rey) the source of their cynicism and try to convince her (Kern, who is eavesdropping on his neighbors, show to Valentine the dark side of human relationships and their dark secrets/Luke asks Rey to reach out with her feelings and realize that the Force does not belong to the Jedi, because the Jedi are a flawed and hypocrite institution). 

* Both old protagonists (Kern/Luke), due to their relationship with the female protagonist (Valentine/Rey), eventually overcome their pessimism by the end of both films. 

* Both films show how the female protagonist is connected with a young male who shares similar struggles and sentiments with her, and they're both destined to be together (in *Trois Couleurs: Rouge*, Valentine and Auguste do not meet before the end of the film, but the movie is constantly showing the parallels between their lives and how one is the answer to struggles of the other/in *The Last Jedi*, we have Rey and Kylo becoming more intimate through the Force Bond, both have feelings for one another despite the fact of they being enemies). 

* Both films symbolically use the color of blood red as a visual identity of their stories.",movies,1602644313,ludwigritcher752,True,1,3,2020-10-13

desperately trying to find title of European drug movie,"Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this. 

I remember watching a brilliant movie in 2012 about a recovering drug addict ( in his mid/late 20s).

I believe it was relatively new at the time, so 2005-onward. It could have been german, or dutch, or swedish, etc. I really can't remember. It was subtitled. 

He may have just got out of rehab, or prison or just been away, but basically what I can remember is that the dude goes around his hometown and talks to old acquaintances and his parents before eventually going out to a sort of club/rave situation, after which he eventually ends up at this empty house with and empty pool before eventually relapsing. I remember the movie kind of thematically saying the pressure from the positivity of his parents and old friends was too much to handle and what drove him back to drugs, or something like that. Like it was this optimism that others had he couldn't handle, or that everyone was buying into his recovery but himself- instead of some messed up/negative circumstances forcing him back into drugs. Like the positivity was destructive in the shame that it brought. I remember he gives in near the end with that empty pool in the back of  the big empty house. 

I realize this is really damn vague but If I remembered anymore (like the country/language the movie was made in) I could have found it already I think. I have spent hours. 

Anyway whatever this movie was it was super good and has hung around in the back of my brain since.

Rank Baumbach's Filmography,"Baumbach is one of my favorite filmmakers working today. I consider him the heir to Woody Allen in the sense that he tends to make a very specific type of movie about a very specific type of person. His movies tend to be very autobiographical, which means they're not necessarily the most ""creative"" stories, but on the other hand they come across as very sincere and authentic. 

Here's how I have it: 

**1. The Squid and the Whale (2005)** - This might be the most archetypal Baumbach movie in terms of hitting his key themes and motifs. You have the dysfunctional family dynamic, toxic narcissist creatives, and wayward creatively-inclined person struggling to find a direction. The Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney characters are positively acidic at times, while the Eisenberg character is enjoyable as the flailing young Baumbach stand-in. 

**2. Marriage Story (2019)** - It's his most accessible movie and his highest-rated on review aggregators. Personally, I prefer 3-4 of his other films, but this is objectively his biggest success to date. 

**3. Kicking and Screaming (1995)** - Rough around the edges, but a sign of things to come. It's full of levity, but packs surprising emotional clout. It might capture the bittersweet inevitability of change better than any college movie I've seen, and in some ways is like the ""stuff private college"" version of Dazed &amp; Confused. What happens when the party is over? 

**4. Frances Ha (2011)** - This is another coming-of-age story, and in some ways a logical extension of ""Kicking"", showing the challenges of young adulthood in a big city. 

**5. Meyerowitz Stories (2017)** - Almost functions as a distant sequel to The Squid and The Whale, except now the Baumbach surrogate (the Ben Stiller character?) is more grown up and the creative father is much older, on the backslope of his life. Family is a core idea in Baumbach's stories and this one seems to be a portrait of healing and learning to let go of grievances. 

**6. Greenberg (2010) ** - A portrait of a toxic man-child. It's one of my personal favorites from Baumbach's filmography because I know people who are exactly like the protagonist, but it's also a movie that isn't going to play very well with the general public since the Stiller character is so hard to stomach. 

**7. While We're Young (2014)** - It's not objectively one of his very best, but I enjoyed it. You could say it fits right in the middle of Frances Ha and Marriage Story on a chronology, depicting the transition from ""young adult"" to ""real adult"" before shit hits the fan and goes south (ala Marriage Story/Meyerowitz).

**8. Mistress America (2015)** - It's essentially ""Lady Bird goes to college"", with the Lola Kirke character feeling like an extension of the Saoirse Ronan character from that film. It hits some of the recurring Baumbach themes like plagiarism, artistic integrity, and the challenge of juggling ambition with basic human decency. It's watchable, but overall meanders in places and is one of his weaker efforts. 

**9. Margot at the Wedding (2007)** - I'm going to be honest, I haven't seen it since its initial release. It left such a feeble impression on me that I barely remember it, whereas I remember The Squid &amp; The Whale very well despite having only seen it once, and earlier. That's not a great omen, but perhaps I need to revisit it now that I'm older. 

** N/A - Mr. Jealousy (1997)** - I haven't seen it yet! Maybe I'll watch it tonight. 

I almost want to put Lady Bird in here because the line between him and Greta seems blurred at times, and it feels so much like his stuff, but that would be a bit disrespectful to Greta. There's obviously some shared DNA there though.

Any recommendations for really scary or at least well written/interesting horror movies for a jaded horror fan who has seen it all?,"I’m looking for some good scary horror movies to watch during October but the problem is, basically no movies ever scare me anymore. But maybe some would surprise me I don’t know. If a movie were going to scare me, it’d probably be more along the lines of psychological/well written horror than just gore and torture porn. 

Also, I’ve seen lots of horror movies and chances are I’ve probably already seen it if it’s halfway decent. Or if it’s on Netflix since I’ve basically devoured most of Netflix’ horror catalogue good and bad. 

But there’s gotta be some good ones I’ve missed so hope you guys can help me out. I don’t care how old or new the movie is, and I don’t mind subtitles or anything, just looking for some good ones. Also, since probably no movies will scare me anymore, I’ll just settle for any good entertaining horror movies too even if they’re not super scary.

So my wife had an interesting idea for a movie,"The idea was something along the lines of a person whose life isn't doing super great and one day he sees a random reddit post or doesn't internet search for ways to improve situation x y and z or advice on how to help when your life is falling apart and it comes to a reddit post that basically addresses the situation and he follows the advice in it and then over time through that advice or continued answers or continued advice from that person would improve his situation and he then would somehow become successful and have the resources to find that person to thank them for somehow miraculously always having the right advice and his time of need and then she ends up being like the love of his life or something like that or his next door neighbor who he never even really knew blah blah blah.

The Clive Owen film Trust is such a remarkable display of acting,"
Back before he disappeared he was in a small indie movie called trust in 2010, and boy is this one of the finest examples of acting that no one knows about. The film is about a very young teenager who gets groomed and ultimately is raped by a child predator. Owen is the father, and while the daughter is actually the real star of the movie, this is by far his best performance. I never thought was a real powerhouse of acting before this film but his's raw, honest emotions here is just remarkable. I'm glad the movie never even flirts with the idea of this film turning into an action filled revenge clique. This movie is just about the aftermath of a tragedy, in fact there's such a lack of healing or sense of justice with this film it's extremely hard to watch.

But the real star of this film is the then child actor Liana Liberato as the daughter, and good god this is by far the best acting I've ever seen from any child. SHe's so good and real it's actually hard to remember this actually is a child I'm seeing act like this. I don't think she's had much of anything of a career after this movie, which is a tragedy. The dialog is so real and free of cliche, it's also very smart, like anything we as audience member would think we would say in these circumstances everyone here inevitably says. I can't really comment on anything like cinematography and music, the film is to low budget and acting focused to really do anything special with that type of thing. This is one of the films, that while extraordinary, is extremely hard to sit through no matter how many times I've seen it. The very last scene, after everything else is resolved and the father and daughter have some tiny amount of healing with each other, is especially a punch in the stomach and I think is a bit unnecessary, since the story propper is already over. I'm not sure where anyone can find this film right now, but it's very worth it if you want to see an extraordinary display of acting,especially from Liana, she really is beyond compare imo.",movies,1602461420,Mikecirca81,True,1,20,2020-10-11

Film critic you agree with a lot?,"To this day I haven't found a professional movie critic who I didn't think had a number of horrible takes. Leonard Maltin famously trashed The Thing (1982) as well as The Shining (1980.) He seems to automatically give a movie a 4 star review if it's more than 70 years old.

Roger Ebert's favorite film was Citizen Kane? Come on man. It's historically been considered the greatest of all time and it also happens to be your personal favorite? Bold!

Briam Tallerico trashed Joker because it didn't have a clear and concise political message. Come on dude not everything has to be Republican versus Democrat. The movie wasnt an allegory about political affairs, it was a film about what led a guy down a dark path. THATS IT.

I dont know if this guy is regional or national but on the radio I heard a guy who goes by Willy Waffle and I usually agree with his takes. He seems more blue collar than a lot of critics.

I just find many critics to be very pretentious or they try too hard to find a deeper meaning in films. I like the phrase ""Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.""",movies,1602470939,Gbpxl,True,1,41,2020-10-11

The players are in a crowded stadium and the movie is pre-2010s

Question about accuracy of scene in Thirteen Days (Cuban Missile Crisis),"Probably some actual knowledge of the history of the CMC needed here as well...

But at the end of the movie, there is a scene where Bobby Kennedy is doing a final negotiation with a Soviet official (ambassador?). Just as the Soviet guy is about to walk out, Kennedy finally offers to dismantle and remove the Jupiter missiles from Turkey, thus sealing the deal. I believe this is what happened IRL as well, removing those missiles compelled the Soviets to agree to terms and remove missiles from Cuba.

BUT in that scene, Kennedy tells the Soviet guy that the Jupiter missiles were already obsolete and were already planned to be removed.

This seems like a HUGE negotiation mistake and I have a hard time believing Kennedy or any US official would have admitted this to the Soviets. It basically makes it seem like the US isn't really giving up anything and I feel like the Soviets would have asked for something more if they knew those missiles were going to be removed anyways.",movies,1602285326,Not_a_throwaway20,True,1,6,2020-10-09

But unfortunately the script wasn't good enough and gave itself far to much to do and could have really benefited from some fleshing out. Despite those issues the first half of the movie is actually really good, but the second half is completely rushed and weight of the whole thing collapses on itself.

The good the bad and the ugly. Tuco's gun,"Ever since I saw that movie, besides being amazed, I never understood how Blondie took Tuco's gun, but more importantly how much time had passed since they blow up the bridge to the soldier's and poncho scene. You can see in the ""spectacle"" bridge scene how Tuco is checking and (correct me if I'm wrong) reloading his pistol, so if Blondie had unloaded his gun the night before, it wouldn't have mattered. So the only option is a day between, but a passing day isn't shown and they kind of seem to be in a nearby place, as the horse and the dying man are sign of recent battle, also, there's the fact that they inmediately dived into the river but by the time of the second scene, they seem dry. That Tuco scene either was a mistake, a day actually passed or I'm paying too much attention to a detail that does not matter (which I don't feel it is, given how amazing and detailed is the final product).

*Their scary looks are meant to scare away evil spirits

*They paralyse their sleepers to prevent them from hurting themselves at night after having a nightmare which is why they're called sleep paralysis demons.

Snakes on a Plane is my favorite feel good “horror” film,"I haven’t seen Snakes on a Plane since it came out when I was a teenager. Last night I watched it again and so many moments made me chuckle. 

No, I’m not talking about the comedic relief moments from Keenan Thompson or Samuel L Jackson (although those were fine). I’m talking about just the ridiculousness of this movies. Here are the “worst” parts that I thoroughly enjoyed:

1) The premise. It feels like some film student project where they come up with the concept of snakes on a plane (Aptly naming it “Snakes on a Plane”) and then desperately built a weak plot around it to justify how that situation came about. I admit it was slightly creative with the hit on a murder witness. But the idea that this career criminal chose such a complicated, high profile, not so guaranteed way to do it, is pretty hilariously unrealistic 

2) The bad 2006 CGI of the snakes. It would have really helped if they at least mixed in some footage of real snakes. But through the eyes of 2020 the CGI looked so fake that no adult could get scared at this movie 

3) if you have a bare basic knowledge of snakes, the ridiculousness is extra heightened. 

3a) For one thing, pheromones is not going to turn the snakes into murderous monsters that will stop at nothing. It makes them primarily horny. If there are both male and female snakes let loose, they would be too busy fucking

3b) there are no venom on earth that can kill you literally instantaneously. Most snakebites can take hours or even days to kill you

3c) snakes only bite to eat or as a last resort of self defense. They won’t actively seek out humans. Also won’t fling their bodies through the air to bite you 

3d) there is no venous anaconda size snake with a full set of teeth that will kill and swallow a human man. Even if it did, he would spend hours digesting him and wouldn’t need to eat for weeks thereby neutralizing the threat 

4) im no plane expert, but pretty sure it would kill everyone to shoot a hole in the plane mid flight. That’s also a pretty ridiculous, overkill way to get rid of the snakes. Why not use the taser or torch or literally any kind of weapon to kill them?


But all in all.. it was very entraining and I would recommend.",movies,1602291049,cantbtamed,True,1,3,2020-10-09

Name that movie: desert island movie,"This film used to come on sometimes when I was little on a local channel that showed syndicated stuff. I think it may have been made or distributed by New Line Cinema.
I started it a few times around 1992 to 1995 but never finished it.
It has a man and a woman that were in a plane crash or shipwreck. They end up on an island and he swims out to a ship sticking up out of the water for supplies. I think there are pigs or chickens on the island like it used to have a resort but was abandoned because of storms.
The man and the woman bicker/fight a lot. The guy looks sort of like Charlton Heston. Barrel chested and scruffy. The woman reminded me of Kathleen Quinlan.
I can’t find anything on the Google machine about what it is but I know it’s not: Swept Away, Blue Lagoon, Six Days Seven Nights.
I want to finish this movie since I started it thirty years ago and can’t remember what it’s called. It looked like it was made in the late 80’s or early 90’s.",movies,1602292651,WackyWalliferous,True,1,6,2020-10-09
"""The Wolf of Snow Hollow"" (2020) - thriller dramedy directed by and starring Jim Cummings","Just saw this at a local theater that recently reopened for limited screenings. I have to say for my first time back to the movies in many many months, I was pleased.

Cummings is known for his 2018 film ""Thunder Road"", in which he also stars, which I haven't seen, but based on descriptions of the plot and his role I suspect he drew on that character for inspiration in this film in his role as Dep Sheriff John Marshall. 

I was happy to see Robert Forster -- an actor who has always delivered -- in this as well, but sadly and unbeknownst (somehow) to me, this was to be one his last film appearances, having died almost exactly a year ago.

Anyway, my thoughts on the movie!  First I'll say that despite this movie being billed as a comedy-horror/thriller, the comedy elements give it more of a comedy-of-errors kind of feel. I don't want to give away too much, but Cummings does a great job in both his directing and acting showing how incredibly inept a small-town Sheriff's department can be when it comes to major crimes. That said, I think he was also careful, given the times we're in, not to paint cops -- small town or otherwise -- as dimwits either. As is laid out as a plot mechanism early on, the case they're dealing with is something they have to handle whether they want to or not, and ultimately these cops (with the exception of Cumming's character) are shown as skilled professionals, albeit human beings who respond to extreme or stressful situations about as well or as bad as any person might.

I think the script falls short in its attempt to fully flesh out a supernatural whodunnit.  While it does a great job making you wonder whether you're watching ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" or ""Wolfman"", keeping the audience a few steps behind the culprit and knowing whether the killer is actually a monster, Cumming's clear desire to show a town and law enforcement agency in disarray (when faced with such a terrible ordeal) goes a bit overboard and I found myself a bit confused at times.  This feeling came to a head when the big reveal happens toward the end and I was left wondering what I had missed.  The movie is horror/thriller that \*wants\* to be a whodunnit, and the potential for being a great amalgam was there, but missed the mark a bit.

Don't get me wrong: this was a really fun movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and will definitely be seeing it again. I hope Cummings continues to make films of the dark comedy/horror type and others as well. He's clearly a talented guy. His acting -- along with that of the actors he directed -- was fantastic.

Overall 4/5 stars and I highly recommend seeing it while the Halloween season sets the perfect backdrop!",movies,1602292723,harbelblarbel,True,1,15,2020-10-09

What's a movie you enjoyed that you haven't seen mentioned a lot on the Internet?,"I want to hear about some more off-the-radar movies that people have enjoyed. What about the movie struck a chord with you? Bonus points if you can set the scene without spoiling too much of the plot.

Since my post was too short, let me volunteer a couple of my own, to kick things off. I loved a 2016 indie movie called [Don't Think Twice,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RFTpObS95U) which starred Keegan-Michael Key and many others. It followed a group of broke friends in New York who do improv in their free time. I remember being blown away by the quality of acting, and ever since watching this movie, my opinion of the Oscars has slowly dropped whenever I remember that there are amazing performances out there that never get recognized properly on the big stage.

A great foreign film I saw was [The Devotion of Suspect X,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpfBF5dJqwk) which was a Chinese film based on a 2005 Japanese novel. It felt like an absorbing 2-hour long episode of Law &amp; Order, and I grew to care about the characters and thought the ending was original and very interesting.

Question about the speech speed in older movies.,"I'm currently watching Duck Soup, and I can't help but notice how fast the actors talk in it, like in many pre-New Hollywood films I watched (especially from the Golden Era.) It happens a lot in comedies and a few drama/film noir, like The Maltese Falcon (although it's less apparent here.) Sometimes, they talk so fast that it sounds like these old newsreels they used to show in theaters before the TV's democratization. As a non-native speaker, it makes these movies a bit harder to follow for me, and it's somewhat frustrating.

But am I crazy? Did they really talk faster in old Hollywood films? If so, is there a reason for that? A quick Google research didn't offer many answers, other than the acting in early movies was heavily influenced by stage productions, the speech included.

What are some good movie recommendations about a protagonist desperate to get a job or role?,"
I’m looking for storylines/characters similar to the tone of Black Swan, Whiplash, and Nightcrawler. Preferably stories with anti-hero’s. 

I need this for a feature length film I’m trying to write, the idea isn’t fully developed, but I was hoping I could get some inspiration from narratives with an unethical protagonist yearning to get a job or role. However, if you’re not able to provide a story with a protagonist who’s an anti-hero, please still drop a recommendation. Like for example, a movie similar to pursuit of happyness would suffice.

What Is Your Favorite Profound/Thoughtful Movie Quote?,"Everyone loves a memorable line from a film. Whether it be Samuel L. Jackson screaming at ""Brad"" about his linguistics in Pulp Fiction or Clint Eastwood questioning someone's luck there are so many famous one liners. 

But what are some of the most profound/thoughtful quotes that make you think. The lines from a character that may be brutally honest or philosophical that hold so much meaning. Things that come to mind for me are multiple different quotes from the Before Trilogy, but the most profound quote to me is one from The Perks Of Being A Wallflower:

Books of Blood (Hulu Original),"I seen the first movie and going into this I expected something similar to that because of the name of the movie.

Well, I got to say it was nothing like the older one but damn... this one was incredibly well done. At first it feels like any typical horror movie pacing but it literally has tons of unexpected twists and turns in the story that all interconnect to the ending of the movie.

I was on edge the whole time in full satisfaction and amazement with the atmosphere, characters, story and everything else. 

It felt like a mish mash of the older book of blood as the bone of the story while everything else (still connected) is like a mix of the OG Texas chainsaw massacre movie with a little splash of House of 1000 corpses and just a drop of the classical A24 horror vibes.",movies,1602300116,Jonuh666,True,1,14,2020-10-09

Fargo (1996),"This is on Netflix at the moment and so I decided to take this opportunity to check out the Coen brothers’ classic black comedy.

Overall, it’s a pretty entertaining experience. The big strengths here are the script and the performances. The latter is packed with morbid humor of both the verbal and visual varieties. You’re either on board with that kind of thing or you’re not. I like dark humor so I found it consistently funny with about an 80-90% success rate in terms of jokes landing. So if you like dark humor, you’ll probably like this. But if you don’t, this isn’t likely to convert you. The actors also do a great job inhabiting the very colorful characters the Coen brothers have written here, putting on delightfully ridiculous accents and relishing the big comedic beats that most of them are given at least one or two of.

As far as problems, the main one I had is pacing. While the film is never slow or boring, the main plot (i.e the unplanned triple homicide and subsequent police investigation) doesn’t really begin until the end of Act I, which I can see bothering some people during that first portion. I’m also not sure the Mike Yanagita scene was particularly necessary. Sure, it was slightly amusing, but not as much as the rest of the film, and it doesn’t really tie into the plot at all. I think perhaps it should’ve been cut. The picture is only 98 minutes long, so these already minor pacing snafus are offset by the brisk runtime. Another minor issue is one I have with many black comedies. Often, because the comedy is so bleak, the line between what’s supposed to be funny and what’s supposed to be serious becomes a bit blurred. As such, the impact of the serious moments aren’t always as strong as they could be.

All in all, though, I thought this was a very amusing journey into the upper Midwest, and I encourage any fans of black comedies to check this one out if you haven’t already. To those who have, thoughts?",movies,1602301012,movieguy2004,True,1,6,2020-10-09
"""Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives"" is the quintessential 80's slasher movie","This is about as perfect as it gets. A great mix of intensity, thrill, gore and fun gives the movie a flavour that would make Gordon Ramsay jealous. Right from the start they introduce Jason with a [James Bond homage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rlW38INlCQ) at the end and it's hilarious.

The movie is poking fun at the franchise and the slasher genre without beating you over the head with it.
It has the best looking Jason imo, some witty dialogue and is actually well directed. Without spoilers, the movie has a cool final battle as well.

Do you care about any of the main characters? Of course not. Was I cheering for Jason the whole time? You bet!

Weirdness in Innocent Witness (2019) IMDb Page,"So I was looking through some Korean films to watch with a club I'm in when I came across Innocent Witness (2019). The letterboxd reviews were all normal and rated it moderate to highly, so I just had a look on the IMDb page for the film as well. The film is listed as just 'Witness' on IMDb, but it's the same one. It's about a schoolgirl with Asperger's being the sole witness to a murder and a lawyer's attempt to get her to testify in court.

From the description and the trailers I saw, there is absolutely no romance between the protagonists (the lawyer and the schoolgirl) hinted at at all. And apparently this is the case in the film as well, which is obviously a good thing.

But the weird thing is all the top reviews on the IMDb page for the movie are low rated and complaining about this lack of romance? Some of the most incel shit about how this movie didn't ""push any boundaries"" because it didn't portray an age gap romantic relationship (remember one of these characters is a minor and the other is in his 40s) when it never showed any sign of trying to do that. Some of the reviews say it was marketed as such but from what I see in the description and trailers, none of what they claim to have seen is present whatsoever. These reviews have a lot of users saying they found them helpful, while the most downvoted reviews are not only highly rating the film but also actually more relevant to its actual content, and some also mention the weirdness with the top reviews. I have a feeling it's a circlejerk with all the nonces upvoting each other's reviews to keep them at the top, but why did so many of them review this movie in the first place?

I didn't go into detail about the reviews because there's some genuinely weird shit in there but I definitely say take a look for yourself because I need someone to help me understand what's going on. This is not the kind of film I generally would think would be the target of bots or trolls, at least not English-speaking ones considering the film is in Korean and not from a super well-known in the West director like Bong Joon-ho or Park Chan-wook. So I don't get it.

I wasn't even sure where to post about this, but it seems someone in this sub noticed a similar phenomenon in the Blade Runner 2049 IMDb page being overrun by misogynists https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/imtxgm/weirdness_in_blade_runner_2049_imdb_page/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

"What are your favorite ""Big Swings?""","I love what I call “Big Swing” movies, the big risky weird blockbusters that show up every few years. I’ve been thinking (and watching) a lot about them since Patrick Willems posted the amazing video essay discussing what he calls “The Modern Class of Gonzo Cinema.” The way I classify these movies are as follows:

1) Hugely imaginative  
2) Massive special effects budget  
3) Impressive worldbuilding  
4) Kinda bonkers  
5) Not part of an existing film franchise

The last point is important because films like “Aquaman” or “Mad Max: Fury Road” tend to succeed at the box office while ones not part of a franchise in this category are almost always box office bombs.

However, something that I've always noticed is that while some of these films can have their ""creepy"" moments, I've never considered them scary. It's hard to tell whether the films were legitimate horror for the time and we've just become desensitized, or if it was all just advertising blown out of proportion.

Just Wondering about RE-MAKES,"With all the re-makes of movies that SHOULDNT be re-made, what about some movies that SHOULD be .... a great example of this is Judge Dredd (Stalone) being re-done with Dredd (Urban) .... what are some other movies that SHOULD be re-made to be better or updated.

I'll list some that I think should be ..updated or possibly re-made

1 . The Maltese Falcon (I look a good Noir type film)

2.  as good as it is NOW I think in todays times 12 Angry Men would do well

3.  Another (few) as good as they are NOW, Cline Eastwood's Nameless Cowboy movies being remade I think would do VERY well - The Good the bad and the Ugly, Few dollars More...etc.",movies,1602121696,paridonian,True,1,19,2020-10-07

FARGO (1996) - Marge meeting Mike,"Just rewatched this great flick tonight. I've probably seen this movie a dozen times. The story, the writing, and the dialogue is perfect in every way. But there's one thing I'm still not getting. What was the significance of the scene when Marge met her long time friend Mike at that bar, and later discovering that he lied about marrying Linda? Is it mainly a moment to further define Marge's character as a somewhat naive, well-meaning individual devoid of meanness. Towards the end, she told Grimsrud ""Well I just don't understand it."" in regards to his crimes. I see this as Marge just being a ""super lady,"" overly optimistic despite her occupation as a police officer and good detective.

Apocalypse Now is one of the best films to grace cinema in the past century.,"Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece of cinema (at least the theatrical version is). Filled to the brim with subliminal messages, philosophical commentary, and good old fashioned violence. Telling the story of Captain Willard (Benjamin Willard for fans of the redux) and his PBR boat crew as they make their way up a Cambodian river on their mission to assassinate a deranged and insane Colonel Kurtz. Despite the infamy surrounding the production of this film the product is absolutely top notch. The score alone including Wagner’s “Ride of the Valkyries” and The Doors “The End” as well as psychedelic and indigenous pieces is enough to set this movie a bar above the average film. Each piece tailored perfectly to the scene it’s present in. This psychedelic journey introduces us to a slew of unforgettable characters, many of which well known, such as Willard himself, baby-face Laurence Fishburne’s Clean, The Chief, Chef, Robert Duvall’s Colonel Kilgore, and Brando’s Colonel Kurtz. The introspective look at the ethics of war as well as it’s ability to show us the truth about human nature is beyond fascinating. There are so many different scenes you could write a thesis on it’s hard to point just one out. Even aspects of the movie not entirely meant to have deeper meaning, such as Brando’s Kurtz being covered in shadows because of Brando’s weight gain, still have depth regardless of whether it was intentional or not. The build-up of meeting Kurtz is hinted perfectly throughout this movie which I think is enough evidence to show how well paced the movie is throughout the film (at least the theatrical version). Each set piece coming into the film at an appropriate time to showcase the different aspects of war. Some criticism I’ve seen against the film has a lot to do with it not being a good Vietnam story. Which is fair criticism considering it’s inaccurate depiction of Montagnards. However where the movie fails to be an accurate depiction of Vietnam it succeeds significantly at being an accurate depiction of war or rather an accurate depiction of the essence of war. How war can tear human beings apart and show them the worst aspects of themselves and other. War can warp reality almost with it’s ability to engulf anyone and anything it comes across. I believe this fact to outweigh the inaccurate portrayal of indigenous Vietnamese as well as make the movie a timeless piece that will always be relevant as long as war is involved in human culture.",movies,1602125634,PancakesOfLife,True,1,11,2020-10-07

Need Help Remembering Movie Name,"Hey movie lovers! There’s an image in my head from a comedy film, but I can’t put my finger on the name. The scene is a younger person who is sent “upstairs” in the firm where they work (possibly a law firm or ad agency) to see the senior partner. This senior partner is a little old man (balding with dark-rimmed glasses) in a big chair, in a dark office, surrounded by medical equipment - IV’s, an oxygen mask, tubes, etc.). The idea is that the junior partner is learning about the sacrifices required for success at the firm.

"Movies similar to a ""A Bittersweet life"", except darker and newer if possible?","Watched bittersweet life for the first time last night and was blown away. Phenomenal 10/10. I definitely don't want anything older than 2005. Thats my threshold. Since everyone always asks why...it's just a personal preference. It's easier for me to get into things that look newer. 

In summary I basically want a heavily gang themed movie, that's dark, 2005 or newer and with VERY MINIMAL COMEDY/ROMANCE. None is ok too.

I was having an Asian movie week so I watched the following as well last week: 

Asura City of Madness. It was ok. I didn't particularly love the way it was filmed. 

Oldboy. Insanity. And by that I mean insanely awesome. However I don't want to watch anything similar to this for a while.

I saw the Devil. Another rare 10/10 for me. Perfect movie for the plot. I don't have a single critique really. 

Drug war. Tried it. Fell asleep after 15 minutes. Might try again. 

A new world. Was good. But people hyped it up too much so I went in with crazy high expectations. Still a good movie, just not perfect. 


What's next for me fellas? Currently debating on the watchlist:

Got turned off of Triad Election because I heard it's half comedy half gang movie...

1. A company man

2. Infernal Affairs

3. Trivisa

4. Protege

5. Chasing the Dragon

6. A gangster, a cop and the devil

7. Nameless gangster

8. Man from Nowhere

But they have Marla Hooch on the team!? She should be batting 4th, and I believe she does later in the movie. So Dotty makes her own lineup, puts herself in the cleanup spot over Marla, and no one says a word? Seems out of character for several of them.

To anybody still upset about the Bruce Lee portrayal in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood...,"That was not Bruce Lee. It is not intended to represent Bruce Lee. Tarantino, I'm pretty sure reveres Bruce Lee. Hell, who in Hollywood doesn't? The guy is a legend. However, back when the movie Once Upon a Time in Hollywood takes place, Bruce Lee wasn't quite a legend yet. Also, Hollywood and American men weren't anywhere near as socially conscious as they are now.

Here's the deal. That scene is a fantasy in Cliff's mind as he does his boring job. He wants to go work on set but can't because people don't like him. He's off-putting and has a reputation for probably having murdered his wife. He dreams about what would happen if he went to set. Rick would probably be able to talk them into hiring him. He would go sit around with the other stunt crew and, for sure (and again, this is purely the train of thought of Cliff Booth, all american machismo stunt man in the 60s and 70s) that Chinaman Bruce Lee would probably be there, running his mouth like always, disrespecting American greats like Muhammed Ali. Cliff, being unable to just let it slide would have to call him out and, sure enough, they would have to fight. Cliff imagines himself putting Bruce Lee in his place, embarrassing him in front of everybody, and getting to be the hero. But, those damn snowflakes and losers, they'll probably hold it against him and fire him and he'll be right back here where he's fixing Rick's antenna. He sighs, relieved to be both the victim and hero in his own story. Everybody else is the villain for not recognizing him for his talents and inherent worth as a white man.

It's the Hollywood male fantasy. Sure Cliff murdered his wife but it was because... she what? Had it coming? He's not so bad! He's the hero of the film! Right? Just like people still defend Roman Polanski. Sure he raped a young girl but it was a different time, he was traumatized from his wife's murder, he makes incredible movies blah blah blah. It's bullshit. And Tarantino, who had been recently called out by the MeToo movement, wanted to make his statement on the fantasy we buy from Hollywood. I keep seeing articles about Inosanto or some relative of Lee's being upset about the portrayal. Sorry to them but look at the context. It isn't Bruce Lee, it's the perception of Lee by a racist guy who imagines himself an American hero of sorts. That's Hollywood. That's America. Bruce Lee faced it in his life plenty. I think he would recognize the scene in a heartbeat.",movies,1601939519,mikerophonyx,True,1,13,2020-10-05

'The Village' is the most conflicting film I've ever watched.,"  


I'm confident most of you will simply reply with,"" The Village SUCKS,"" but bare with me....

Saw it in Theaters when I was 14, all my buddies and I went to see it specifically to see if we could survive the scary scenes. Only for all four of us to be saying to ourselves during the second half: ""Please say the Monsters are Real! Please Please!""

I'm conflicted because I find myself always coming back to it. The Cinematographer is Roger Deakens, so many shots in this movie are beautiful. I'm from Upstate Ny and the environment is similar to what I grew up with, which hits me on a nostalgic level. The acting is amazing, and the cast is great. I believe one of the biggest casts M. Night has ever held. James Newton Howard's score is iconic, haunting, and beautiful. I remember back in 05 when I had it on CD and would listen to it all the time, and scare myself with the music on creepy foreboding nights. The set is great, I love that they built an entire rustic 19th century town in rural PA. That really brought a great authenticity. The dialogue is well written, makes the time period feel more vibrant. The wardrobe is great, although a bit too clean. The first half I believe is very good, it is very enigmatic and I feel holds true to drawing you in. You get lots of good questions and a few thrilling moments that are very well done. I do believe M. Night is very good with making Thrillers.

Then comes my conflict. The second half has good potential but I feel like some video editing choices could have been used to give the film a bigger impact. I don't think we should've seen Lucius get stabbed. Although I do enjoy how silent the scene is and the way it is shot. It would have been far more compelling if we just saw Noah with blood all over him sitting on the porch with the audience trying to figure out what happened. Keep Luscious' attack a mystery. The second half of Ivy getting the big reveal in the shed should've been shown way later. They show it right before a huge scene that would've been better for suspense purposes, if we still had the idea that the creatures were real. We get this creature chasing Ivy and all we're doing is sitting there thinking, ""Well the guy just told us they weren't real a few minutes before this."" There is that line of, ""There were rumors of creatures in these woods."" I just don't think that's enough to sway the audience once again, especially after showing them the creatures are farce. I don't mind M. Night's acting but his cameo in this should've been cut, he treats the audience like they don't get it. Spends the entire time over explaining everything giving way to much exposition when we don't need it. M. Night admitted at a comic-con panel he messed up with the marketing. Marketing The Village as a Horror was a bad choice since it is very obviously a love story. A good love story I might add, a better love story than Twilight. I think there are too many twists in this movie, should've stuck to one. If it were me the creatures should've been somewhat real but have the time period be the true twist. I'd like to see what Stephen King could've come up with filling in this plot.

For what ends up happening it doesn't make any sense for the creatures to be making bear and monster noises, although it is cool. There is a deleted scene that shows why there are horn noises in the forest so that makes sense. Everyone's acting is brilliant: Phoenix, Brody, Hurt, Weaver, Gleeson, Jones, Bryce Dallas Howard isn't bad but she had moments where I was like.....uh okay this is too much. I believe this was her first feature role, so she gets a pass in my book. I'm assuming Noah is the one who has been skinning the animals and leaving them around. If not they really should've addressed who was doing that. But that makes Noah's character far scarier. If I wrote it I would've made his character a Serial Killer from the towns. Having him pretend to be mentally challenged to keep people from suspecting his intentions. Either way, he's pretty god damn dangerous for a person who's mentally challenged. The very last shot in this film I always loved. I love how they're choosing to use Noah's death as proof that the creatures exist. The way Ivy shows up and says her piece as she walks through the room of people and it goes to black with the music building quickly after. That scene has always given me chills, I love how they filmed/wrote/blocked that scene. Also the reflection of the red cloak in the stream at the beginning of the film and the reflection of Ivy's yellow cloak at the end of the film is also superb. I love the contrast and I love that it's the same stream. So for many who don't know Jesse Eisenberg is a pretty prolific background character with a few lines from beginning to end.

I personally believe M. Night is a great director, I think his writing is on and off. I loved Split but I think he shot himself in the foot with Glass. His blocking and shots are superb, I love the way he captures a scene and tension, he always gets the best performances out of his actors.

Also sidebar: I believe M. Night was sued when this movie came out because it was very similar to a novel that came out in the 90's. So I don't know for sure if he actually wrote this or stole it from that novel. He had a studio backing him up so he won the case.

Will postponing movies until 2021 saturate the theaters causing the movie industry to lose money?,"From what I have seen this year, movies that have been released on demand seem to have done pretty well. I would assume that is because the general public is hungry for new movies. For example Mulan is estimated to have grossed over $62 million in the first weekend and that’s on top of having a paid subscription. So it makes me wonder why movie companies would choose to wait until 2021 to release their movies when it could possibly hurt them because there will be so many to watch. Will the average person spend that much money in one year to watch movies especially when a large portion of the public is trying to recover from unemployment due to shut downs.

Weird Science is an absolute blast.,"I’d never seen this before but the concept sounded intriguing so I gave it a shot. I’m glad I did, it’s a lot of fun. The leads all have great chemistry and the characters are written in a way that, while not exactly original, make you really root for them. It’s also consistently funny with a good mix of fairly obvious jokes and stuff that’s so out there that it becomes funny just due to how unexpected it is. That’s also my main problem with it, though. While some of the random humor works, some of it’s so out of left field that I was left more confused than anything. But I’d say 80-85% of the humor lands with varying degrees of success, so not too bad. It’s also got an awesome ‘80s soundtrack, with the theme being a great standout. (I’m actually listening to it on the DVD menu as I type this.) I just wanted to talk a bit about this one because it’s just so enjoyable.

It only got more confusing and I was wondering if I was missing something obvious. All of my ideas of what was happening were shot down by the end of the movie.

Ari Aster is the only director who could pull off a remake of A Clockwork Orange,"I’ve given this a lot of thought over the years. First, the question of whether someone would ever possess the talent to successfully remake any Kubrick film in general, but then the second thought of remaking A Clockwork Orange specifically. I have finally found my answer.

Ari Aster. I’m convinced he’s the only one who could execute such brutal content in a somehow mesmerizing, haunting, jarring, brilliant way. 

Both Lars von Trier and Darren Aronofsky would go too dark, too visceral; they wouldn’t be able to find that delicate balance that Aster is able to. 

I realize what a bold statement this is, but I stand by it. If that film were to ever be remade, as of present Aster’s the man for the job.",movies,1601946450,francesburgess,True,1,5,2020-10-05

Worst looking film from an otherwise talented cinematographer,"Christopher Doyle-Psycho (1998)

Y'know, I'm fine with Psycho being in color and all but...why are the colors so goddamn bright most of the time? Even in the nighttime scenes, there are bright colors. This is supposed to be a suspensful horror film but it ends up looking like a campy John Waters comedy with how bright the colors are in most scenes.

The camera being able to move into the building, though, an effect they wanted to do but couldn't back in 1960, was kinda cool, though, I guess. Otherwise it's a pretty ugly looking film.

&amp;#x200B;

Dean Cundey-Jack &amp; Jill (2011)

I know Adam Sandler comedies aren't really known for their technical skills to begin with but, even by Happy Madison standards, this is a pretty ugly looking movie with how it feels like they're trying to make sure the 2 Sandlers aren't in the same shot throughout the majority of the movie or the orange and teal color scheme.

Excuse me while I gush about Hardcore Henry,"So, I watched it first some amount of time ago, and remember always thinking “man, that was a neat film” whenever I thought back on it. Then me and some of the homies had a movie night with it over discord just now and **Uh Oh It’s Really Good** but I’ve never really heard it spoken about.

So the obvious selling point is it’s gimmick of being a first person action film, and while that’s neat as hell (and somewhat jarring at first) there’s a lot more to this movie than just that. It’s got a soundtrack that slaps and is used really well, cutting in and out with fantastic timing. The cast all do a fantastic job, with Evil Tommy Wiseau (Danila Kozlovsky’s Akan) being a creepy and threatening villain but the true star of the show being, without a doubt, Sharlto Copley as Jimmy. Really Jimmy alone’s good reason to watch it, but if that’s not enough then the action and fight scenes are brutal, gripping, and surprisingly easy to follow considering the first person perspective. The plot, while relatively simple at base,  has some neat elements and serves as a great vessel for the characters, the action and the stellar writing.

It’s not perfect, true. As I said, the camera can be a bit weird to watch at times, and there are parts that feel a bit gratuitous, but the main complaint I have is that some of the CG looks *really* cheap. That said CG effects are rarely used, I can remember 2 examples from the whole thing, and instead it’s mostly practical effects which look solid. That’s it that’s my complaints section. 

If you have the time and a way to watch it, I fully recommend it. &gt;!i don’t know where we streamed it from i forgot to ask!&lt; Then again I might just thinking this is a hidden gem that everybody already knows about, but I kept forgetting it existed so maybe y’all did too, in which case, I say rewatch it, it’s still good the second round.",movies,1601948164,GreyMJ,True,1,5,2020-10-05

Spotlight: The forgotten Best Picture film,"“Sometimes it’s easy to forget that we spend most of our time stumbling around in the dark” - Reporter Marty Baron

It may seem strange to call an Oscar winning best picture film underrated, but five years later and I feel Spotlight is often forgotten when talking about great movies in the 2010s. The film contains an all-star cast full of great performances, but the biggest stars aren’t the actors. It’s the writing. It’s the directing. It’s even the subtle cinematography. The film follows the Boston Globes Spotlight team as they investigate child sex abuse cases in the Boston area by Catholic priests. A rough subject and what I love about this movie is how grounded it is. You follow reporters as they go through the nitty gritty of investigating. There are no explosions, nothing graphic and certainly no car chase scene of priests trying to stop the reporters. Sometimes the most thrilling parts are when you see reporters go through newspaper clippings and doing monotonous interviews. That understated and realistic tone is so impressive given how riveting the film is and that’s due in part because you know what bombshell is lurking in the shadows. This is writing and editing done best. Journalism is one of the least appreciated fields and it’s vitally important in keeping powerful institutions in check and ensuring victims aren’t forgotten.

What are your thoughts on The Dictator (2012)?,"I saw this movie for the first time yesterday after only seeing clips on YouTube and it is one of my favourite comedies of the last decade.  Sacha is amazing in the lead role and he definitely carries the film along with Jason Manazotukas (who is great on Parks and Rec).  The humour really worked for me and it reminded me of a cartoon in live action at times (kind of like Family Guy to me).  It did get a little too cartoonish at times and the film loses its focus towards the end (ex - scene where Aladeen helps the pregnant woman) but for its purpose, it still worked well.  I can see why critics were mixed on this film as the humour can be edgy at times just for the sake of being edgy (but this didn't bother me).  The romance with Anna Farris felt very rushed and I feel the film was too short (75 mins without credits).  I'm curious to know what others thought of this and how it compares to Sacha's other stuff.  It was a very Aladeen movie I'd say.",movies,1601770338,Person884,True,1,21,2020-10-03

What movie have audiences generally become kinder to as the years have passed?,"Maybe the film's lore has been expanded in sequels, spinoffs, other media in the years since the film's release? Maybe the themes resonate better in a modern social climate? Maybe the film is oddly prescient and predicts future technologies and events decades before they come to fruition. For whatever reason, what film can be considered profound or more enjoyable or clever ain the years since its release, owing to poor reception or viewership during its initial run?

 I think films like Blade Runner are a good example in that the film wasn't truly appreciated upon its release.",movies,1601770808,KentuckyFriedEel,True,1,146,2020-10-03
"An NBK-esque film involving bar fights, and some guy getting shot in the heart.","I, (17M), need some help with finding a film that I accidentally stumbled upon when I was a child.

For some context, my family used to live in a one-story apartment during my infancy to early childhood. Sometimes, I'd wake up in the middle of the night to find my dad asleep on the recliner watching films; mostly porno from the pay per view channels, I think.

However, there's this one film that really caught my eye when I was a kid. I'll try to explain the details to best of my ability. It's really long, nonsensical, and inconsistent.

Now, I caught a glance into this film, probably near the end. So, the end credits was probably set to the backdrop of blue and cloudy skies, with blood presumably running down the screen. Very similar to the opening of Natural Born Killers.

I saw three characters, two male and one female, being driven around in a van by an asian guy wearing a baseball cap or a dad cap.

His van would be parked out of bars, or pubs; I assume he acted as a getaway driver for the three characters.

The three would enter these bars, and proceed to kill, or beat up a lot of the patrons, which mostly consisted of gangs of buff guys who genuinely put up a fight.

However, in one particular bar, one out of the three protagonists got shot in the heart; and I think only he, and the female made it out of the bar. (I'm not sure about what happened to the third guy, though. Maybe, he actually made it to the van, or got killed. I'm not sure.)

But, back at the van, this guy was bleeding out from his chest, and she's just starts breaking down on top of him, trying desperately to apply pressure to his wound.

I don't think I caught much after that. I went back to the movie, only to see that same guy who got shot, perfectly fine; and with some gauze on his chest.
It's day time, and he's having a conversation with this other guy near that very same van, in the dessert.

And, I think that's how it ends.

Keep in mind, that I was just a child when I accidentally saw this. So the details can be hazy, or I maybe wrong.

I hope I can find this film, because I've been thinking about for the past couple of years.",movies,1601770846,emotional_belladonna,True,1,0,2020-10-03

I saw The Trial of the Chicago 7 at the cinema - it's terrific.,"This past Friday I saw The Trial of the Chicago 7 at the cinema here in Australia. Other than in the state of Victoria, most cinemas are open here, with distancing between seats etc. Although I have Netflix I wanted to take my grandfather to see the film (he doesn’t have Netflix) and support the theatre.

I admire Aaron Sorkin a lot and adore his screenplays of The Social Network and Steve Jobs. I also like Moneyball and A Few Good Men, and also thought Molly's Game was pretty solid. Although this film isn't as good as The Social Network I thoroughly enjoyed it all the same.

I like reading up on events and I'm a bit of a history buff but I didn't know anything about the Chicago 7, which benefited. I'm sure the trial itself wasn't as dramatic in real life as it was depicted in the film but the theme and message at its core is prevalent. Sorkin does a great job in conveying why these men felt so passionately about ending the Vietnam War. With the film being released shortly before the US election there's talk of it potentially influencing the election. Personally I don't see how the two are connected a lot but I will say that had this film been made and released during the central period of the second Iraq War, then it would've had a great impact.

Sorkin makes what I don't think is the most interesting and dramatic story into something truly riveting, as he has done with so many of his scripts. If one looks back on the stories of his screenplays most screenwriters, tasked with writing about the same subject, would turn in something less interesting. As you'll see in this film, he makes moments supremely dramatic, such as when Eddie Redmayne's character Tom Hayden utters certain words in a speech. Sorkin creates such tense and intrigue - it stirs. Think in Steve Jobs the confrontation between Jeff Daniels' John Scully and Michael Fassbender's Jobs over the event that caused Jobs' sacking from Apple. 

When watching the film you certainly get a sense of someone who has great experience in writing good courtroom drama. It's something we've seen numerous times throughout the decades, whether it be in film or TV, and it's not an easy nut to crack. Sorkin delivers again, as he did with A Few Good Men, however, unlike that film, The Trial of the Chicago 7 can't wait to get into the courtroom (the title isn't wrong; The TRIAL of the Chicago 7) and doesn't leave it until absolutely necessary. The film doesn’t get bogged down in too much back story, there's hardly any characters depicting the defendants family etc, there's not much lead up into actions - everything is setup before the film begins.

There are some slight missteps, though. Although Frank Langella does a fine job in his role as trial Judge Hoffman, I think he was a tad bit too hammy. I don't know what the real Judge Hoffman was like, but surely a judge couldn't be that arrogant, aloof and downright biased, right? He's also racist, but this was the 60s, so that part is probably more accurate. There's also moments that are focused on but there are no great payoffs, such as when Hayden's character sensationally stands for the judge, and when Michael Keaton's Ramsey Clark enters the film (which is both impactful and not).

The performances are all great, in particular for me Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Rylance. SBC plays the very non-serious and also deadly serious Abbie Hoffman, which he does so with great charm, and he and Jeremy Strong (definitely the laugh winner of the film) bounce off each other very well in their double act. Rylance plays the 7's lawyer Bill Kunstler. At first I didn't expect him to have a great role and be eclipsed but the other roles, but he shined through and quietly goes about his business of defending the 7 with calmness and intelligence in equal measure. He and Redmayne are the level centre of film. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the prosecutor is also very able, but he doesn't have a great deal to work with.

Sorkin's direction is also very good, but I don't think he has dramatically improved a great deal from his debut with Molly's Game, but it was a great debut job. The script is that good that it directs itself.

Over a fine film and for me one of the best, so far, of the year. That's of course what has been released this year. The film is surprisingly cinematic, so it's a shame it'll be seen by most people on the small screen - although I think a majority of films are cinematic because I love the cinema so much. Although how ever it is shown I think it's important that people see it.

I hope everyone also enjoys it.",movies,1601774005,MrColfax,True,1,16,2020-10-03

Do any exist?,"Looking for a super hero/ blockbuster action film styled film like Pacific Rim but with some key changes: 

- humans as a species are not saved in the end (even if the physical earth may be)
- it is not overflowing with ""hUmAnS aRe ThE bEsT sPeCiEs"" propaganda (e.g. magically any other species, regardless of how obviously powerful/ equipped they are the rest of the film, somehow falter in the last 10 minutes of any battle sequence so humans can win).
- film shows what happens directly after a total nuclear war in a *realistic way* vs ""the apocalypse could be fun"" way
- film shows how plants, animals, non-human life recovers and goes on to have a wonderful existence without humans

I (24f) know I’m late but I don’t think 365 Dni deserves the hate it gets.,"SO. I have two reasons so far aside from it being juicy.

Disclaimer: I know the movie has very ~bad~ elements... Stockholm syndrome... fetishization of female victims... sexual harassment... and so on. 

My first reason that this movie gets a pass from me is that in reality it’s a porno... softcore that is but still a porno. Not to mention it’s based on a smut novel. Pornography or smut is SUPPOSED to tap into fetishes and kinks. Being held “captive” and dominated and all the other sexual elements in 365 Dni are common arousal triggers. Now, everyone has different opinions when it comes to what topics should or should not be depicted or discussed in pornography or smut... some people think the darker kinks and fetishes should be done away with but that’s a huge topic for another day. This film is really just watching porn without the depiction of actual penetration (what softcore porn is)... very commonly enjoyed by people especially the ladies. 

This brings me to my next point. I’m a lady... and do not find this offensive. No, I’m not saying that just because 365 Dni gets a lady’s approval then it’s for sure fine. But I am saying that this story is female centric in that it mainly focuses on Laura (a female) and how she feels. I can understand Laura in a huge way because I too know what it is like to face the huge issue of sexual assault and harassment on women (something that is extremely anxiety inducing for me)... and yet I found this film... like many other darker pornography I’ve come across... not threatening at all. To back up this anecdote, the story was written by a woman, she also helped with the film. This furthers my point that this story is female centric and taps in to fantasies that many ladies have. 

It’s just, I found this film to be fun and pretty hot. It was juicy... I couldn’t look away for long and had to see what happened next. I think people are too hard on it because of its taboos... taboos that are common in pornography.... taboos that are common fantasies... fantasies that are desired by many women... plus, women helped make this story! Anyways. Let me know your thoughts!",movies,1601774553,sweetfuzzybitch,True,1,14,2020-10-03

"Nicolas Cage has been in some bad films, but they would have been worse without him","Here's the main topic of discussion: Is Nicolas Cage a bad actor?  Or is he just in a lot of bad movies?

Nic is a controversial actor.  Some people think he's the worst actor, while others, including myself, think he's a great actor (more on that in a bit).

I've seen a lot of Nicolas Cage movies.  I've enjoyed lots of them (The Rock, Face/Off, Con Air, National Treasure films), but one of the ""bad"" ones made me realize it wasn't bad because of Nic, and it most certainly would have been worse without him.  Primal is something you'd expect to see as a Cable TV film where Nic stars as an exotic animal poacher stuck on a ship with a deadly assassin.  I didn't hate the film, but I think I would have if it didn't star Cage.

I think Cage's strongest asset as an actor is his versatility; I can't think of any other actor who has the range Cage has.  Not even two time Academy Award winning actor Tom Hanks has the range of Cage.  Nic can literally play any role convincingly: Comedy, action villain, action hero, romantic lead, soldier, rescue worker, super hero, braniac treasure hunter, fantasy swordsman, etc.  Tom Hanks may have been a romantic lead, soldier, and braniac treasure hunter, but he's never been a fantasy swordsman, a super hero, or a particularly evil antagonist (The Ladykillers and Road to Perdition are like the closest, and even in those he was likeable).

The following clips illustrate the range of Nicolas Cage:

Disney pricing their new releases at $30 on top of regular Disney+ subscription sets a bad precedence for future of streaming,"With release of Mulan at $30 on Disney+ even if you had a subscription doesn't really bode well for us consumers in future where we have to shell out extra money even after paying for 3-4 subscriptions already on average (Netflix, Disney+, Prime, HBO). Some of the companies in India have already started following Disney's lead and putting new movies out of subscription for $35 to $40 rent. This was really scummy from Disney when they increased the subscription price by 50% here when lockdown started. I wouldn't mind paying a little bit extra as a part of annual subscription to offset for new movies but selling them out of subscription is bad for consumers and with a big company like Disney leading the charge,  most of the local smaller companies will follow.

Please help a small indie theater survive; they need all the love and support.,"I'm not affiliated; just a fan.

I've been so lucky to live near a fantastic indie theater for years.  Cinema Arts Theatre in Virginia has been a wonderful showcase of indie, arthouse and even the occasional blockbuster film.  For over twenty years they have been operating under the shadow of the big chains.  The owner is fantastic and I feel has been a essential member of the community.

Lately they are in survival mode (much like any other entertainment venue).  As of now they are still showing films; if you are in the area please consider going.  They really care about the presentation.

They also offer a selection of streaming films on their site.  They get half the proceeds.  

If you love movies and theaters please consider supporting them.

The Host (2006) is on Tubi right now and is a fun time.,"This is the third Bong Joon-ho movie I’ve seen. (I first saw Parasite, which I loved, and then Mother, which I thought was fine enough. I also saw the first 15 or 20 minutes of Barking Dogs Never Bite, but it honestly didn’t really do anything for me so I turned it off after that. Maybe I’ll try it again sometime.) While I won’t call The Host his best movie, it is probably his lightest and most easily enjoyable. It has a great sci-fi plot and solid characters brought to life by some fine performances. It is too long in my opinion and the CGI isn’t great, but it’s a pretty fun monster movie that I enjoyed. On a side note, the climax is probably the best part and it features one moment in particular that almost made me applaud despite being in an empty room watching this alone. Check this one out if this sort of thing appeals to you. To those who have seen it, what did you think?

Tom Holland in a western - He did really good in ""The Devil all the time"" and after that performance, I kinda want to see him in a western. 


Johnny Depp in a movie about a Rockstar - The man is a rockstar in real so I'd like to see him star as a rockstar in a movie. It'd be a very different role for him but one he could pull off. 


Liam Neeson in animated movies - He has a very recognisable voice and he was really good in ""The Lego Movie"" and ""A monster Calls"" (not animated but he voiced a giant groot) so I'd like to see (hear) him in more animated movies. 


Nick Frost as a toughened criminal in a crime movie - He's a really funny comedic actor but I'd really like to see him in a serious crime movie where he plays a toughened, violent criminal.

Psycho II (1983) was a surprisingly good sequel to the original and psychological thriller in its own right.,"I remember thinking, ""A sequel to Psycho made after Hitchcock died? Seriously""? I finally watched it and  was enthralled from beginning to end.  Director Richard Franklin handled the suspense quite well. and Perkins is fantastic and brings depth and sympathy to Norman Bates. Jerry Goldsmith delivers a haunting score (also amazing to see one master composter follow up another, Bernard Hermann) and Dean Cundey (Halloween, The Thing) provides some great shots. I didn't quite care for a twist in the end but it didn't ruin the movie for me. Overall a worthy sequel. Heard Psycho 3 isn't bad either.

Looking for the best Modern Asian movies about gangs.,"Alright movie peeps. I call on you! So I've finally hit every good American, European and Latin American movie and tv show about gangs.

Before anyone recommends Raid...I've seen both and that's not what I'm looking for. Also watched Giri-Haji (10/10). 

Criteria is as such. 

1. 2014 or newer. Personal preference. 

2. Preferably no humor or comedy. Would like this to be dark and serious. 

3. Movie. NOT TV SHOW.

4. Nothing horribly low budget.

Hot take about original Willy Wonka being about purgatory.,"All of the kids represent a deadly sin.  Veruca is greed, Mike Teevee sloth, Violet is pride, Augustus gluttony, and Charlie envy.  
They all have a version of consciousness that tries to help them being their guardian; some more vocal then others.  
They all magically or “by chance” get a ticket to see a person that no one has seen before even though owning a factory in a rather large town.  
So in this Willy Wonka represents the devil of sorts always temping and never really preventing the pitfalls the children encounter.  The oompa lumpas are the demons that just do Mr. Wonka bidding also never helping the children really.  We never see the kids again after their outcomes and left to know nothing of them and Wonka only really talks about the torture the kids will go through to get out of the factory.  
Each kids is put against their greatest weakness; gum chocolate, gold, being on tv or in tv, and then Charlie who will end up getting money and not being poor any longer. 
The only one that overcomes this is Charlie bucket who gets everything he ever dreams of, after being whisked away into the sky and essentially given a ticket to “Heaven.”

I have never read the book so this is just interesting about the original movie, or the only movie; did they remake it??????  Nah don’t think they did.",movies,1601423116,candycoateddeath,True,1,4,2020-09-29

Imitation of Life: Don’t remember too much, but it was about a mixed-raced woman who disowned her mother, who is Black and works as a maid. Her mom tries to reach out, but the MC keeps pushing her away. And then the mom dies. I know, I know, old melodrama doing what old melodramas do best, but wow was that funeral scene at the end something!

My Octopus Teacher: A new(ish) documentary on Netflix about the filmmaker forming a bond with a wild octopus that he studies everyday and eventually interacts with. I won’t spoil it for those who want to see it (or maybe I should?) but much more emotional than you’d think a nature doc would be.

Won’t You Be My Neighbor: The Mr. Rogers doc, mostly because it’s so nostalgic and I miss him!

"We are the Spielberg generation. How a director shaped a generation, teaching us a love for knowledge, the past, and the future."," 

***Jaws, E.T,  Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, Schindler's List, Hook, Saving Private Ryan***

If you were born between the late seventies and now chances are at one point in your life, one of your favorite movies was a Spielberg film. From 1977 on, he has shaped us through his movies, showing us just how influential cinema can be. I genuinely believe that this is a great thing; just look at how he makes us look at the world.

His films introduced wonder back into the theaters, after the doom and gloom of the seventies. E.T, Hook, and Jurassic park remind us that being and child and childhood memories are important. He lets us reconnect with the whimsical.

Indiana Jones, Jurrasic Park, and Jaws feature strong characters of education, inspiring many, such as myself, to look into the fields of Archaeology, marine biology, and paleontology.  His movies also increased the interest significantly in those fields. What kid didn't want to be like Indy in the 80s or Ellie Sadler in Jurassic Park?

His films look to the future what we can do if we apply ourselves personally and globally. 

He also taught us to remember the past, Schindler's List,  Amistad, Saving Private Ryan. Many of us learned about the horrors of war through his films, the holocaust, D-day, and the devastation of the slave trade. He shows us that the past has immense pain that we must not forget. We can not forget their stories.

Though there are many fantastic directors,  few have impacted our culture that Spielberg has.",movies,1601431020,TheMediocreCritic,True,1,32,2020-09-29

Sci Fi movie where kids turn into aliens,"I remember seeing a movie probably about 10 or so years back.  I don’t remember too much from it, but I can’t find it anywhere.  I believe the movie took place on a space ship(or some mostly metal location).  They were getting attacked by aliens which if my memory serves me right, looked like bipedal naked mole rats.  I don’t remember any actors, but I remember there were two kids who turned into aliens throughout the movie.  I’m not sure if they were aliens the whole time, or if they got infected.  There are two scenes I remember.

1.  One of the characters were hiding in a nookish area and the alien jump out in front of the character. Jump scare style. Terrified me as a kid.

2.  Another character was hiding behind a post (maybe in an air duct?) and one of the aliens stuck their head through the ceiling and was looking around for the character.  Couldn’t find him and went back under.

Let me know if these two scenes ring any bells.  It’s driving my crazy that I can’t remember this film!",movies,1601437131,JosephCraftHD,True,1,3,2020-09-29
Similar movies/shows to Ten Inch Hero?,"I've recently watched Ten Inch Hero and now I'm just obsessed. I'm not really sure what it is that draws me to it. Just the closeness of the characters, the generally bright and accepting atmosphere, the setting. Priestly is just an awesome character and makes me happy just by being on screen, and I just related to Jen a lot. It fills me with so much joy and hope. I want what they have so so much, and this is the closest I'll ever get to having it.

Looking for a Recommendation List for Legendary Movies That I NEED to see.,"Iv never been much of a movie guy so Iv missed out on soo much in film. 

I recently saw some films iv always been hearing about like Shindlers List, lost in translation &amp; most david lynch films. I never put much thought into them before, I just thought they we're popular and not much else but damn some of these films where just amazing, forcing me to feel such heavy emotions with soo much to appreciate. 

It got me thinking about how many 'legendary' films I don't even know about.

I'm going to be on a big watch spree for awhile so I would love as many recommendations for some Legendary 'Must-watch films as possible.

Just thought I would share how I rate my movies based on the IMDB 10 star system,"First off I think the 10 star system is a bit ridiculous. I feel like rating it anywhere between a 1 and 4 basically means the same thing. But doing a 5 point system makes 1 and 2 sound the same. 

So I do the 5 - 10 system and it's based on the reaction I have when someone asks me 'should I go see movie  X?'. And here it is below 

5: oh gall, no that's a terrible movie, don't see it 

6: eh... It was okay I guess. I wouldn't see it. 

7: I'm glad I saw it, but I wouldn't see it again 

8: A solid movie, I'd watch it again 

9: Absolutely incredible, definitely see it

10: One of my all time of my all time favorites, I watch it every year.

The 10 rating is important and I think being able to watch a movie multiple times is important. 

But I've been using this rating system for a while now and I seem to always be able to rate a movie now without trouble",movies,1601440786,Jinjoz,True,1,4,2020-09-29

Help me find two films! Transfer 2009 and Cargo 2010,"Hey all!

Netflix used to have two films which are no longer on the platform and I’m trying to find them and having zero luck.

Transfer from 2010 is a German film
It’s about an elderly couple that is able to transfer their consciousness into the bodies of two young Black people who take control back of their bodies at night.

Cargo from 2009 is a Swiss film.
I don’t remember much about it...
It’s a sci fi about a medic that takes an 8 year journey on a cargo ship where the crew died mysteriously.


Does anyone have any leads on how to stream, DL or rent either of these?!
I have tried to find dvds and haven’t had any luck in that department either.

It seems they’re wiped from the internet entirely 😭😭

I’d be super grateful if anyone had any leads.

Could have tied together both DS9 and TNG's fanbases for the film. I have no doubt it would have done far better than Insurrection. It could have easily just Picard and crew going behind the lines to investigate some nefarious plot that could doom the defense of the FEderation.

The pacing of tenet was way too fast for a movie that has a long runtime,I rewatched tenet and holy shot the movie pacing was way more rushed than I remember. The first act moved at an inexcusable pace. There barely any room to breathe and even the “slow” scenes like Kate and the protgranist having dinner the scene had too many cuts with continuity error. I know Chris changed editors and had Jennifer lame edited the movie but holy shit I can’t believe it was her work considering how slow paced her editing work in marriage story was. She never worked on a blockbuster thriller  before   and I felt she made it fast pace because that what she thought would make the movie exciting because she had no idea how edit a thriller.

Of the two scenes I remember:

1. The judge would ""listen"" to the cases of people (including a very large group), and he had them cluster together so that they would all fall into the trap door. That door had a conveyor belt where their flesh would get stripped off their broken bones, and the bones would get spit out into a massive bone heap.

"Blade Runner 2049 was visually impressive, but it wasn't visually interesting.","The  overall aesthetic and atmosphere and special effects were fantastic,  don't get me wrong. The movie has excellent setting, and the setting is  shown off beautifully.

But after I  just rewatched it for the 3rd time since seeing it in theaters when it  first released, I just feel there's never anything very interesting  going on as far as CAMERAWORK goes. Not many memorable visual sequences,  or shots that make me think ""holy shit, this is awesome"" or making me  want to take in the entire frame because a particular shot is dripping  with style, etc. It's all very straightforward and just ""here's what  you're looking at, look at it.""

When  I love a movie, I usually get the urge to watch it multiple times and a  huge chunk of my enjoyment that comes with rewatching something is to  do with revisiting amazing camera shots and 'eye-candy' sequences.

Blade  Runner 2049 is a lot of cool futuristic lighting and cool special  effects without any eye-pleasing camerawork to frame it all.

Anyway,  I see this movie get a ton of praise in EVERY category, deservedly so  for things like its story and score and acting etc. etc. but visually  (the primary thing I watch movies for, personally) it's just not very  rewatchable IMO. Some of my favorite movies are long and slow, pacing  wise, but this movie manages to be long and slow visually as well and it  just bogs it down.",movies,1601251895,Mr_Mu,True,1,2,2020-09-27

Then as he describes the fight between Atom and Zeus as an insult to his creation, without specifying what that creation was.  Is it possible that Tak created Atom and for some reason abandoned him before becoming a recluse and eventually creating Zeus, so watching Atom is like watching his past self contend with his current self, which is why he's so mad at the whole fight?",movies,1601253898,Merlin22,True,1,2,2020-09-27

"I'm thinking of ending things, who do you think Lucy is?","Heavy spoilers: 



I know the movie shows heavily that Jake is the old man. 

But I think Lucy doesn't just represent Jakes old gfs. I think she represents literally all of them, all of his past, all of their pasts. 

We see Lucy act like him repeatedly. The push and pull of their dynamic is obvious. Shes constantly shifting, but so is he. 

We see Lucy act like his mom, as she talks loudly to cover up the awkwardness and stutters and mispronounced words, especially in front of jakes anger. We see his dad is obviously dismissive at times and probably has similar anger issues that probably exacerbated his moms issues. When jakes dad says he misses his mom, she lays her head on his dads shoulder. In the car in front of the school we see her saying to herself rhat he's not a monster, he doesn't beat her, so maybe she should just stay. Seeing jakes dad standing over his mom in the flashbacks screaming, we can infer jakes dad had a temper and his mom tolerated that abuse because he never got physical. 

We see Lucy act like his dad in the car, being dismissive, making fart sounds, tearing things down. We see her poo pooing the silver linings, the way jakes dad does. We see her almost playing mind games at time to make him upset. 

And the pig ultimately says we are all each other and everything. So while she was a stand in of his oast gfs and random movie romances, she was also his parents watching and observing. 



Another theory I think supported by the movie js that Jake is gay or asexual. Supporting evidence is that they repeatedly state he never found a nice girl, girls find him awkward, etc. We see his dad imply he's a ""Nancy"" and flat out say it. And when Lucy mentions homosexuality in terms of things once blamed on bad parenting, we see Jake get defensive and say homisexuality isn't wrong, isn't like the other things. 

Ultimately jakes life has obviously been driven largely by fear and regret, so while he daydreams of a perfect romantic relationship, he may literally have not had the sexual attraction needed for his ideal situation and was too scared to address the option of being gay, due to societies bad views. We see he obviously has an aversion to his moms touch which may reflect a weird dynamic he has with all females. Though he obviously has some visual attraction, hes obviously afraid of women to some degree and holds them up. This is evident with the Tully ice cream woman, somehow that stands out in his mind and represents an almost serialized role and a material role as shes thiccccc AF and is leading a bunch of kids. 


What do you think? Do you think the movie said there is all to say or do you think there's more going on in the background?",movies,1601254710,DrDouchebaggins,True,1,13,2020-09-27

Coneheads (1993),"This is on Netflix right now and I wanted to bring it to your attention for those of you who haven’t seen it. It’s based on a series of SNL sketches and centers on a family of aliens who crash land on Earth and are forced to blend in with human civilization. It features a ton of great ‘90s comedians whom I won’t name because it was so fun recognizing a familiar face in so many scenes and I’d like new viewers to have the same experience. 

I saw that the Rotten Tomatoes score is only 35% and I’m not sure why. It’s very clearly not trying to be anything more than a goofy sci-fi comedy with some gentle ribbing at ‘50s suburbia and U.S. immigration policy thrown in as well. On that level, I thought it fully succeeded with consistent laughs and some pretty decent prosthetics and CG for the time. It’s also only 86 minutes long and paced well so it goes by fast.

The Little Hours (2017) on Netflix is one of the funniest and strangest movies I have ever seen,[removed],movies,1601259419,Alpha_Bit_Poop,True,1,2,2020-09-27
"The Little Hours (2017) One of the funniest and strangest films I have seen. [Alison Brie, Dave Franco, Kate Micucci, Aubrey Plaza, John C. Reilly, Molly Shannon, Fred Armisen, and Nick Offerman]","So the movie is primarily a comedy, and it has everyone in it: Alison Brie, Dave Franco, Kate Micucci, Aubrey Plaza, John C. Reilly, Molly Shannon, Fred Armisen, and Nick Offerman. The story takes place in a nunnery in the 1300's and the film completely commits to it's setting. So it is great seeing the in period castles and buildings and old bridges. In addition the audio recorded in these authentic buildings sounds amazing, the wonderful echo of stone walls and small rooms. The story centers around about 7 characters, and the story is very well done with constant motion and not really dragging or slowing down.

It is also incredibly funny, it had me rolling with laughter, especially Aubrey Plaza playing an evil villian, she is incredible as a bad guy. The humor is very normal modern improv dumbness. But the movie also had a depth and intelligence beyond the humor that you don't normally see in comedies, or even most movies. I won't list out what I thought was clever just to avoid spoilers, but I think the movie draws heavily from authentic old stories to give it smart twists. In addition there is authentic emotion that is well executed, which is another element most comedies don't have.

But really you have to watch it for the laughs, and to be WTF'ed by the structure. It is incredibly unique.",movies,1601259833,Alpha_Bit_Poop,True,1,46,2020-09-27

Avengers endgame plot detail that bothers me spoilers.,"So antman basically discovered time travel. But they only have enough to go into the past once and return once.  Tony then goes into the past again gets more particles and returns home.   But then why can ant man still use his powers if he is out of particles?

There is even a joke where Scott screwed up and ruined one of the tests. So how the hell can he use his powers if he is out of particles!

What's the biggest mixup of expectations you've had before watching a film? How did it affect your viewing of the film?,"I've been really in the mood for time loop films recently, so I watched a few and found more recommendations on here. I just watched a film called The Edge Of Seventeen (2016) which, for some reason, I went into thinking was a time loop film. Perhaps I somehow mixed up the names Edge Of Tomorrow and 17 Again with a memory of hearing this film was good? Anyway, it was a really good coming-of-age film and quite funny, but certainly not a time loop film.

It didn't help that the film opens with the main character bursting into a room and declaring she's about to kill herself, which I presumed was a flash forward to her already in the cycle. It made the film a bit odd to watch at times because when things got bad I was thinking ""okay, it's quite late in the film but she's finally going to kill herself and start the loop"". I was over halfway through before I accepted I must've made a mistake lol.

In the end I still really enjoyed the film, but it really had me looking at certainly things in a bit of a weird way since I was expecting something completely different... which lead me to this question!",movies,1601073740,Lazyfaith,True,1,86,2020-09-25

The fact that it's a murder musical just cements it as one of his more memorable films. Well, memorable in the sense that its a slight departure from his usual hyper violent blasts of cerebral stimulation.

As an aside, I've been a Miike fan for a long time and I was a Blade of the immortal fan as well long before his adaptation. It was an immense source of joy when I found out he was to be the one to bring it to life. I was not disappointed.

Thought on Cuties on the stance of raising awareness,"I was thinking about it and I think it kind of succeeds at what the Director said was them trying to spread awareness in a roundabout way. Thinking about it, and she's right. But all the anger directed at her for sexualizing kids to spread awareness of sexualizing kids, but not at the people who produced it. Any of my friends that talk about it talk about how messed up the director is. But at any point of this films creation, somebody could have stopped it. The producer, the editor, the costume department, the camera people. At any point somebody should have said no this movie shouldn't be made and refused to make it. But now that's it out we're all like what the fuck. 

Cause we aren't used to it, but they were. Used to putting their head down and doing whatever it takes to make money. To the point where REAL shit like this happens every day, it being a known secret and ignoring it. Where were the parents who let their 11 year old go to a twerking audition? They had like 600 auditions. Hollywood has had so many skeletons in their closet over the years that I think people are just numb to it. And it takes this shock to the system to make this not the norm. Somebody makes a child snuff film under the guise of raising awareness that gets released on Netflix and there's no confusion who to blame for making it. Meanwhile the movie is out, fucking pedos get their fix while we yell at the makers of the movie.

What are some movies you think the opposite gender wouldn't fully understand?,"I'm not saying they can't or won't enjoy them, but it probably wouldn't connect with them as much. 

From this male's perspective, I'd have to go with David Lynch's The Straight Story. It's a true story about an old man who wants to visit his estranged brother after finding out he had a stroke. Since he can't see well enough to drive a car, he rides a lawnmower 240 miles from Laurens, Iowa to Mount Zion, Wisconsin. The movie never discusses why he hasn't seen his brother in so long, and the movie is mostly just him very slowly traveling by himself, and when he does talk to people it's nothing really deep or emotional. I won't say exactly what happens, but I will say that it's nothing big or tragic. It's the best depiction of the subtly of male emotions I've ever seen on film, and I feel like it might be too underwhelming for most female viewers if it doesn't go over their head entirely.",movies,1601081330,Mr-Zilla,True,1,26,2020-09-25

A Second Look at Batman V Superman. And honestly it’s very entertaining and exciting.,"So yesterday, I saw Batman V Superman, there were many criticisms of the film but I thought it was great. 

Except for the Martha stuff, I loved the whole movie. Start to finish. I think it’s a great piece of work, visually and artistically.I know the movie got lots of shit for Martha, but once you ignore that, it’s a pretty exciting movie.

I loved Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, he crushed it. I am not a comic book fan so I thought he captured a maniacal villain perfectly.

I was warned that this movie won’t be like the marvel movies and I so appreciate the fact that DC went the way it did in terms of the storyline etc. After seeing both Marvel and DC, I think I prefer DC more because it feels authentic. It doesn’t try to be perfect, and it’s flaws give weight to the script. 

The characters were cast perfectly. Loved Cavill and especially Ben Affleck. He didn’t try to be Bale but added his own flavour to the character.

And bonus point, we got to see Wonder Woman for the first time. I mean, it’s amazing to see your favourite hero on the screen what I saw in cartoons when I was a child.

Everyone touts Infinity War for being a brave movie where the heroes lose.

Batman V Superman did that before Marvel did. No one expected Supes to die. I loved that there was no balance of lightheartedness and dark grittiness.

I would see it again without any second thoughts. 8/10

In this case the movie starts with Bruce's flashback to his parent's dying moments and the last thing he hears his father say is his mother's name. That's a plot point. When they finally do battle we get just what fans of the comic book Batman would expect, he figures out how to kick big blue's ass and just as he is about to finish the job he hears the one thing that makes him see aa shared *humanity*.

"A Life Altering and Devastatingly Honest Experience - My Letterboxd Review/Love Letter to Synecdoche, New York","100

“I know how to do it now. There are nearly 13 million people in the world. None of these people is an extra. They’re all the leads of their own stories. They have to be given their due.”

It is Thursday, September 24th, 2020. The time is 9:34 PM. I’m sitting on the couch in my game room after sitting through the credits of Synecdoche, New York. And I am a mess. 

I said the word “I” and a variation of it twice in that little paragraph. What is “I”? What am I? Am I human? Am I a projection? 

What. I said the word “what” twice. What is what? Is it referring to the unknown? Or is it referring to what we say when we already know something, but we pretend like we don’t in order to create conversation? 

Conversation. What is conversation? What doesn’t take to create an effective conversation? People. More than one person. Or less than two people. A conversation with yourself. A conversation with the mind. Imaginary friends. Consciousness. A persons conscious. 

Conscious. No one knows exactly what a conscious is, but everyone knows that they have one. Some people speak to their consciousness on the daily, almost as if it’s alive. 

Alive. Are we alive? To answer that question, we should take a look at what it means to be alive. Take a look at someone that’s alive. Take a look at yourself. You’re alive. It may not feel like it sometimes, but you are. If you’re alive, you have emotions. That’s one of the most interesting things about being human. Emotion. The ability to feel. Think. Love. Yearn. Touch. Hear. Wake. Sleep. Beautiful things in their own way. But, you can over think. You can overyearn. Touch too many things. Hear things you aren’t supposed too. Wake up late, or wake up when you don’t really want too. Sleep when you should be awake. Everything has an effect on everything.

“Everything is everything.”

Everything has a string attached to it. Nothing you do is one off. It’ll have an affect on you, or someone else, in the future. The future could be a couple of seconds. The future could be ten years. The future could be a lifetime. Something you do when you’re 10 can affect you when you’re on your deathbed.

“Everything is more complicated than you think. You only see a tenth of what is true. There are a million little strings attached to every choice you make; you can destroy your life every time you choose. But maybe you won't know for twenty years. And you may never ever trace it to its source. And you only get one chance to play it out. Just try and figure out your own divorce. And they say there is no fate, but there is: it's what you create. And even though the world goes on for eons and eons, you are only here for a fraction of a fraction of a second. Most of your time is spent being dead or not yet born. But while alive, you wait in vain, wasting years, for a phone call or a letter or a look from someone or something to make it all right. And it never comes or it seems to but it doesn't really. And so you spend your time in vague regret or vaguer hope that something good will come along. Something to make you feel connected, something to make you feel whole, something to make you feel loved. And the truth is I feel so angry, and the truth is I feel so fucking sad, and the truth is I've felt so fucking hurt for so fucking long and for just as long I've been pretending I'm OK, just to get along, just for, I don't know why, maybe because no one wants to hear about my misery, because they have their own. Well, fuck everybody. Amen.”

Loved. Love. Loving. Lover. Love is something that can be either eternal or devastatingly temporary. Love can go painstakingly slow or breathtakingly fast. We’re happy when it’s here, but we’re empty when it leaves. Emptiness leads to loneliness. Loneliness is devastation. 

“I’m lonely.”

Caden is the epitome of loneliness. Our epitome of loneliness. He’s a branch of Kaufman. An extended, withering branch. Withering like a rose tattoo on a deathbed. But he’s not only an extension of Kaufman as a human, but he’s an extension of us. Of our subconscious, of our intruding thoughts. German translating to English through headsets. Inches apart. Love that used to be prevalent, drifting away. Drifted away because of time. Time. The most confusing subject to grace the tongue of humanity. No one knows what it is. If it ends, when it ends, or if it’s even begun.

Begin, begun, began. When does something begin? When does it end? Are we always at the end? Staring death in its face every second of every day, always wondering when he’s gonna take us? If he’s gonna take us? How he’s gonna take us? He follows you. Every day. You don’t see him, but he’s in your shadows. Lurking. Waiting. 

“I will be dying and so will you, and so will everyone here. That's what I want to explore. We're all hurtling towards death, yet here we are for the moment, alive. Each of us knowing we're going to die, each of us secretly believing we won't.”

“It’s a big decision, how one prefers to die.”

Waiting. To wait. Waiting can feel like an eternity, when it’s only been a couple of minutes. It can also feel like a couple of minutes, when in reality, it’s been an eternity. Years in the span of a couple of minutes. Dates on orange juice and the same bland newspaper you get every morning, pretending to be interested in it, when in reality, you’re contemplating your life and everything in it. How you’re going to die and when. You sip your coffee. You hide your feelings. You put on the face people want to see. You live the typical life, but you’re eaten on the inside. Eaten alive. Slowly being consumed by maggots. But no one can know. Except for when you let it out. That one moment when you let lose. But no one really notices. You let loose more often, but your happy mask has become permanent. Hide it. Hide it with humor. A scar on your forehead. A burning house. Living in the moment, when really you’re living in the past, yet still concerned about the future. Lost within time itself, whatever gargantuan, mysterious being it is. 

“I've watched you forever, Caden, but you've never really looked at anyone other than yourself. So watch me. Watch my heart break. Watch me jump. Watch me learn that after death there's nothing. There's no more watching. There's no more following. No love. Say goodbye to Hazel for me. And say it to yourself, too. None of us has much time.”

Lost. Lose. Losing. Losing someone. The thought of it is enough to devastate any human. Take the person closest to you. Take a good look at them. They’ll be gone one day. Forever forgotten. Maybe not by you, but by the world. History and time. Existentialistic terror. We all want to be remembered. No one wants to fade away from the world without leaving their mark. Maybe your mark is the replica of New York. A warehouse inside of a warehouse inside of a warehouse. Thoughts inside of thoughts inside of thoughts. We all want this mark of our own, but we rarely ever achieve it. So we remember this. We don’t think ahead. We think in the now. We live in the now. We live in our own burning house. We know the flames will kill us, but we don’t care. We ignore them. It’s easy to ignore, but it’s not easy to forget. Not easy to forget the pain. Not easy to forget the person(s) that caused it. However, it also isn’t easy to forget the person(s) that helped you through it. That’s how you know you left a mark. You’ve had a fade to grey, but you’ve also had a fade in from grey. Whoever is reading this, know that you’ve made your mark. You may think you’re lost in the dust of time, but you’re not. You’ve impacted someone. But it never feels like that. It always feels like you just disappear from the world. From reality and everything surrounding it. Sometimes you have your Theater moment - your moment in the spotlight. But it always fades away - either that or you do. Caden doesn’t know it, but he’s left his mark. The mark he’s been trying for decades to make. The mark he’s made through the years of thinking he’s sick. Dying. Fading away. 

“I breathe your name in every exhalation.”

Every synopsis that I have read about this film has been gravely incorrect. 

“This is about everything.”

This isn’t a film about theater. This isn’t a film about Caden Cotard building a replica of New York. This is about love, death, sorrow, time, existentialism, consciousness, surrealism, self reflection, depression, anxiety, mental illness, thoughts of every kind, sophistication, and the unknown. This film has had an impact on me that I can’t even begin to describe. I have never felt this way. I laughed. I cried. I don’t know how to put this into words. I will be thinking about this film for the rest of my life. Forever in pain. Forever in love with this film. This is what I’ll be thinking about when I’m on my deathbed, reflecting my life and the events in it. This movie has spoken to me on a level that nothing else has. Nothing has ever felt this personal. This intimate. This intense. This poetic. This piercing. This devastating. I have never cried after a film, but tears were streaming down my face after this. I have been destroyed. I have been broken. I have never felt this way. Not from anything, let alone a film. I have a new definition of cinema. I’m rethinking my entire 100’s list after seeing this. Nothing has ever felt so perfect. This film has pierced my soul. It has pierced my heart and my emotions. It has obliterated my thoughts and intruded into my daily life. It’s all I've been thinking about. I feel like it’s all I will ever think about. This has broken me. This has shattered me and torn me apart. I have never been so depressed, yet so taken aback at the beauty of something. I don’t even know how to put the way this film made me feel into words. Quite frankly, I think it’s impossible. The characters in this film don’t feel like characters. They feel like people. Like extensions of my subconscious. The writing is the most impeccable piece of art that I have ever read. The editing is seamlessly gorgeous. The soundtrack alone is perfect. And the way it all comes together is the most beautiful thing that I have ever seen in my life. Every time I think about this film, I’m on the verge of tears. Full on, unadulterated tears. Not the artificial ones Caden pours into his eyes. This felt like a biography. Not only a biography of me. Not only a biography of Charlie Kaufman. Rather, a biography of the world. An accounting of it as it happens. Like Kaufman is looking at the events of the world and writing the film as they go on. And even though it’s 12 years old, it feels as if it’s still being written. As if every viewing takes on a whole different meaning. As if Kaufman is still adding to it. Nothing has affected me emotionally on this level. Every step I take. Every time I blink. Every time I take a breath. Every time I wake up and every time I go to sleep, I will be thinking about this film. Very few things have impacted my life like this. Changed it, for better or for worse. This has spoken to me. It has touched my heart, but it has also ripped it out of my chest. I can’t put it into words. I want to give Mr. Kaufman a personal thank you. I want to shake his hand and bawl my eyes out as I tell him how he has affected my day to day life and the way I think. I want to talk to him and tell him that I love him. That he has given me countless influences for my future films. That he has changed the way I look at life. That his films have changed not only my cinematic lense, but also my day to day decisions. That the level of detail he puts into his films have inspired me more than any film class I could ever take. That the brutal and unadulterated honesty that he puts in his films will forever speak to me on a deeply personal level. He’ll never see this, and I’ll probably never get to speak to him. And this review will probably blow away in the wind some day. But, nevertheless, Kaufman has prepared me for that. Synecdoche, New York is the best film that I have ever seen in my life. An unfathomably brilliant escapade of metaphorical brilliance and tender, touching themes. And it is now my go too answer when someone asks me what a perfect film is. I never thought The Shining would get dethroned as my favorite film of all time. Things have come close, like Pulp Fiction, Scream, and Terminator 2: Judgement Day. And while I feel like The Shining will forever hold a special place in my heart, and it will always be in my top 3, I must take it down as my favorite of all time, simply because I’ve never had any film cater to my emotions like this one. There isn’t a single thing I would change. There isn’t a moment I didn’t treasure. Not a moment where I wasn’t aching. Not a moment where I wasn’t at this films helm, being controlled by its every move. This is a prime example of why I love film. Why it’s such a big part of my life. And why I truly believe that it is the most powerful form of media to ever exist. 

“I’ve been thinking about dying lately.”

“I will have someone play me, to delve into the murky, cowardly depths of my lonely, fucked-up being.”

I understood Synecdoche. But even if you watch it and don’t understand it, just know that you can rest easy, because I promise that Synecdoche, New York understands you.

Responsible leadership in the United States is going to go further than Tenet ever could towards saving movie theaters, and allowing the release of backed up blockbusters such as Black Widow, Furious 9, and The Batman.

Allowing Trump to remain president will make sure theaters die a slow protracted death. The Coronavirus will continue being mishandled and films will continue getting pushed back.

"""The Hunt"" (2012) has Aged like Fine Wine","I could go about I love this movie and the central performance by Madds Mikkelsen but that has been done to death. Rather I will discuss how this pertains to the #MeToo movement and its rapid spread. Before I get myself into hot water though I will air my grievances with the Academy Awards and their treatment of the movie. While nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film award it lost to the inferior *The Great Beauty*. Now I may come of as biased as *La Dolce Vita* is my favorite movie of all time but hear me out. *The Great Beauty* may stand on its own but it will forever be in the shadow of its big brother, the aforementioned, and will always pale in comparison. Everything Paolo Sorrentino does in his movie is far-less successful than what Federico Fellini was able to do. It's as if Sorrentino took all the personality from the Fellini movie and tried to claim it for himself. Long story short *La Dolce Vita* \&gt; *The Great Beauty*. *The Hunt* should have taken home the award. The other point I want to touch is the acknowledgment (or lack of) of Mikkelesen's performance. Not to say he wasn't recognized (he won the Best Actor Award at Canne Festival among others) but when compared to others it is a severe lack of acknowledgement. I understand the Oscars have a problem when it comes to recognizing foreign language performances but still. Even the reliable BAFTA's failed to bring up his performance. To prove my point I will take you back to 2011 when *Shame* was released. Michael Fassbender won the Volpi Cup at Venice Film Festival and was later nominated for a BAFTA and a Golden Globe. Radio silence from the Academy however. He was ignored by the Academy but still got recognized by prestigious groups. The same can't be applied to Mikkelsen. Awards are just an ego thing at the end of the day but I am still annoyed. No more bullshit, time to get to crux of the matter.  
The #MeToo movement has gained a large amount of traction and has seeped into many facets of life, professional and personal. This rise to power has lead to the downfall of major Hollywood players such as Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey. I am by no means against keeping Hollywood in check, in fact I am for it. Hollywood is rotten and vile at its heart. My issue is that this movement has grow out of control and has become too extreme. People have the mentality of sheep and believe anything they hear, often times when there is no evidence shown. These allegations should be taken seriously and looked into but an individual is innocent until proven guilty. I also believe that these people who make these claims want to have their cake and eat it to. They want to become a star yet don't want to do the work. It is no secret that Hollywood isn't afraid of the casting couch but they still pursue this career. I am not saying it is their fault but sometimes you have to do things you don't like to get places. Not to mention that what is socially acceptable changes over time and lots of these alleged cases have happened over a decade ago. So how does this pertain to *The Hunt*? That movie is about what I talked about above. The main character is a teacher who's life is ruined because of false statements and as a result everyone comes after him. They have a mob mentality and automatically assume that just because someone said it happened means it really did. With situations such as sexual assault or harassment allegations you have to approach it in a level headed manner and not sucumb to madness. People can also present information in biased manner that stretches the facts. Cancel Culture makes the problem worse as well but I don't want to give them the attention.  
Long story short *The Hunt* has aged like fine wine. Just go and watch it.",movies,1600900372,fanatic67,True,1,6,2020-09-23

I want to hear your opinion about Hamilton the Musical on film,"I know it's not a movie per se but boy does it deliver like one. Sorry if this post is not appropriate, but I feel like all movie lovers would be captivated by this piece of art even though it takes part on a stage and the set never actually changes, but the Mise-en-scène is incredible. The actors, the way they sing and move on stage, combined with brilliant text and music is simply amazing. I am not an American, but if I was I would be damn proud of this piece and its portrayal of a significant part of history, hell I'm proud anyways since it portrays the beggining of democracy in general so well. I don't even have a certain group to recommend it too, I think you would all love it if you like art, and then some if you like history, hip hop, r'n'b, musicals or theatre in general.

My plea to Disney.,"Simply put, delaying all your movies is not going to save them from loosing money.

^(*This is all my own opinion and speculation, feel free to discuss if you think otherwise*).

There are two major reasons for this:

1.	Once it’s safe to go to the movies, significantly less people are going to go. Yes, the Marvel fans will burst into theatres, but a lot of casual movie watchers are going to be comfortable just staying home.
2.	Once it is deemed ‘safe’ to open theatres, there are going to be *a lot* of new movies released within a short space of time, and many people are unlikely to want to go see all of them, meaning each film is going to make less money anyway.

And all of this is even assuming that the pandemic is somehow magically gone by May? Forgive me if my research is wrong but it looks like the US is still getting **thousands** of new cases **every day**?? It is stupid blind faith to think that covid will be contained enough to fill theatres in May.

This is also assuming that no theatres have to close permanently due to lack of business, which I expect could happen.

#####Now Disney, please consider the international market.

There are many theatres worldwide that are open and need business! You can’t claim to want to ‘save theatres’ if you neglect the ones  that are open and ready to show your movies.

Start small. Release Wendy. It had a limited US release earlier this year, but since then I’m not sure if it’s had any wide releases. At least in NZ it hasn’t and it’s not on VOD or Disney+. 

I was lucky enough to be able to see it at the New Zealand International Film Festival a couple months ago, and I really enjoyed it. It’s a new movie, it’s a nostalgic story. There are people that will go to see it. It would at least give movie theatres *something*. And you can release it at drive-in theatres in the US and on Disney+ a month or two later.

Now I’m going to be selfish and specifically ask that you consider New Zealand. Frankly, you’re taking advantage of us. You’re still safely making movies here, eg. Avatar, but you aren’t willing to safely release any movies in our theatres?

I felt especially angry when you didn’t release Mulan in theatres for us. I would have happily gone to see it. You used our wonderful country to make your movie, and I’m told you *didn’t even let the film’s crew see it in a theatre*. That’s messed up.

#####What I think you should do with Black Widow etc:

I honestly think you should stick to your release schedule. Get something out there this year that isn’t a soulless remake.

As I said before, I think these movies could still lose money in May. Just release them now, simultaneously online and in theatres *everywhere* where theatres are open.

And I’ve got an idea to help with your online roll out, because people clearly weren’t happy with the $30 ‘Premiere access’ for Mulan.

Cut the price in half. Make Premier Access only $15. That way it’s no more than $25 to subscribe and get the movie. Also, hold it in Premier Access for at least six months. You were really stupid to announce that Mulan would be available at no additional cost in December.

In addition to this, consider releasing the film on regular VOD for a $30 purchase. There are people who can’t afford or don’t want to subscribe to a new streaming service, but would still love to see your movie.

Perhaps that can be a month or two after the Disney+/theatre release.

#####In Summary:
Just release your movies! On all platforms that are available! You don’t know how long this pandemic is going to last, and you cannot rely on theatres to save your movies, especially if you do nothing to save them.",movies,1600904864,TheRealClose,True,1,9,2020-09-23

Is it still worth it for Warner Bros to be in the Christopher Nolan business?,"It's qute the mystery why Warner Bros agreed to give Nolan around $225 million budget for Tenet although he finished it for $200 million but it doesn't change the fact that giving him such a big budget doesn't make any sense. Nolan's trajectory says he'll probably never make a $800+ million movie again. Interstellar made $661 million but Warner expected it to make closer to Inception numbers and Dunkirk was a success but it was still $500 million.

DC movies don't get $200 million budget anymore after Justice League so why should Nolan when his movies don't bring in anywhere near Batman, Aquaman and Wonder Woman numbers? I don't understand why Warner are fine with losing money in order to keep him around when he's past his peak in movie culture.",movies,1600905201,chaincrackers,True,0,26,2020-09-23

"For those that have seen it, what are your thoughts on Spike Jonze's ""Her"", starring Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson?","I personally think this is one of my favorite romance movies of all time, if not one of my favorite movies of all time. I really don't know how to describe how this movie makes me feel other than it fills me up inside with so many emotions at almost every scene. Hearing Johansson's voice say ""Hi"" is like a warm blanket on a cold day. She is so inviting and you just want to hear her speak more. And hearing Joaquin talk so openly about his loneliness and depression just feels so..natural. No excessive crying, no lashing out, just...talking. Getting it all out and not thinking much about his life other than he's sad and doesn't know what to do about it. I know that feeling. 

Anyway, this movie really just made me sit in my bed in silence and contemplate. I didn't cry at the end, but I got close. It made me ponder whether love would be worth pursuing if I could possibly end up like Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) one day if a relationship ends poorly, the only difference being that I wouldn't have a Samantha (Scarlett) OS by my side to talk to lol.

Watching Die Hard for maybe the 100th time and I have a new character that I dislike.....,"The security guard at the beginning of the movie.  


John is dropped off by Argyle and heads into Nakatomi Plaza. He knows that Holly is there but clearly needs some help navigating the place. He's directed to use the computer by the security guard to find out what floor she's on.  


He struggles at first, clearly not one for computers (it's a cute toy). Doesn't find her under her married name, instead by her original name. Cool, plot story, fair enough.

He finds her floor and the security, who's just been standing there, conveniently says that there's no one else in the building so it makes sense that she's located there.   


Why did he have John go through the whole act of using the computer, search for her twice and then finally come out and say it. John could have just walked in and he could have asked, are you part of the Christmas party upstairs, because that's the only thing going on right now.

I know I'm overthinking this and someone will just say ""That's a key part of the plot!"" Fine, but I had to put that out there.",movies,1600910866,Vacaro,True,1,11,2020-09-23

Name a movie that gave you nightmares as a kid,"In my elementary school days, my dad showed me 1958’s The Blob and it absolutely traumatized me. That idea that this Blob could absorb anyone and couldn’t be stop scared me to no end. Sure, the effects were primitive but the thought of a Blob rolling into my room to absorb me plagued me for weeks. Nowadays, I can watch The Blob no problem as all it is a 50s sci-fi movie. Now if I saw the 1988 Blob remake back then I would have been scared into a comatose state but that gladly didn’t happen.

What movies scared you as a kid? Maybe it doesn’t have to be an entire movie, but maybe a single scene in a movie. For example, the spiders scene in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) gave me a distaste for arachnids.",movies,1600913060,ggroover97,True,1,249,2020-09-23

This is how I would have done Seven's ending,"I'm not in the industry or anything. But I did take a film studies in high school twenty years ago, I'm pretty sure.

Anyways, everytime I watch Seven I can't help but think that it would have been so much cooler if when Brad realizes what's in the box and deciding whether or not to shoot Kevin, that instead of just shooting him in the head, he lowers the gun and slowly hands it over to Morgan. 

You think for a moment that Brad understands that Kevin wants him to kill him and so won't let him win and give him the satisfaction. Which is crazy since he must be filled with so much rage.

But then he starts walking up to Kevin maybe even undoing his cuffs (can't remember 100% if he's cuffed), and just slowly but steadily starts beating him to death with his fists. And not just head shots, everywhere. Just pummeling him until Kevin's unrecognizable and completely dead. Just pure wrath.",movies,1600916290,t_d,True,1,13,2020-09-23

We need to talk...about slavery movies,"Below is a quote from Gerard Bush about Antebellum: 

“For me, it’s really uncomfortable seeing people that look like me in bondage,” he told The New York Times. “But what I’ve come to understand is that it is a detriment to us when we are participants in the erasure of the truth because of our discomfort with confronting it.”

“I look at our wonderful Jewish community and how they are vigilant in the protection of the truth and making sure that the horrors of the Holocaust are examined and re-examined,” the 47-year-old Texas native added. “We do ourselves a gross disservice in our unwillingness to explore these stories. The past is going to continue to haunt our present and rob us of our collective future if we don’t confront it.”

My annoyed thoughts: 

&amp;#x200B;

For me it's disheartening that in 2020 we are still being asked to watch brutality of our people over and over. I believe it is the exact opposite, it's negative reinforcement of what has happened to us in this country. It impacts how some black people interact with white people. Your thoughts become things. In the film Trumbo someone said ""Movies are the most powerful influence ever created."" it has the ability to shape the mindset of a person, especially when they are constantly shown something negative. Aside from countless slavery movies, black people are often characterized as these over stereotypical caricatures of actual human beings. It's annoying as fuck. Where are black people in the future?  Where are the scientist changing the world outside of Wakanda? I think I seen one black man in space movie and he was dead in the first 15 minutes. Like WTF!? And don't get me started about when a black man is influential in a film: dead, dead, dead.  We as black people can NEVER forget about slavery, even assuming that is idiotic. We are just now open to the idea of  therapy for all the shit we harbor on the inside from slavery. I don't understand who it erases it for? The white people who don't have compassion about slavery will NEVER have it. Why waste the time? Why do we live in a time of trying to convince other people that they should think and behave as we do? Just be a considerate and loving human being. There will always be some ignorant fucks who are just a lost cause. 

Black children need to be educated and positively reinforced about themselves, to feel good about their blackness, because it truly is beautiful. You wouldn't keep showing a battered woman movies about a woman getting her ass kicked. It just doesn't make sense. Some people have no idea that we created algebra and before there was ever a Bezos or Zuckerberg there's was a Mansa Musa. We don't need another fucking slavery movie. PERIOD. I want to see black people on another planet doing some dope shit, or doing some shit we haven't seen like being multilingual or surviving to the end of scary movie. There is so much more to black people on film. May we never forget what our ancestors endured but reach forward ENCOURAGINS and paving the way for generations to come.

What the Release of TENET tells us about the future of movie releases,"Ok, my last post got removed for whatever reason, even though it was simply my opinion to have a discussion on why I thought TENET's box office gross up to this point in its release shouldn't be immediately written off as a failure.

And while it may be hard to break even still for the studio, it still has the potential to make a small profit from VOD sales later this year. But then again, strong VOD sales usually correlate to equally strong theatrical releases. Now if we were to ignore TENET's budget for a moment and just look at its gross so far, its has made $239.1 million. Which is much further ahead of the equally talked about Mulan.

Now the lower numbers from Mulan can also be attributed to several things. One, Disney isn't providing any numbers on its VOD sales domestically, so we can only go off of international box office numbers for now. And two, its just being released in the middle of a pandemic. The fact that TENET has made $146 million more internationally than Mulan (only making $57 internationally so far), is a testament to the brand of Nolan.

But this also means something else. What films will succeed in a climate such as this? Do you think TENET is indeed a failure, or will it be an outlier by the end of the year when films such as Dune and Wonder Woman: 1984 can rebound profits for Warner Bros? Can it recoup some of the profits when it releases on VOD platforms? Let's discuss.",movies,1600728231,AsleepHovercraft,True,1,0,2020-09-21

Zootopia is the best Disney Animated Movie,"Zootopia in my opinion is the best Disney Animate Movie, let me explain why.

First of all the plot, was great. Going into a kids movie. One might expect a basic PC subpar child fairytale plot. But that is not the case, basically(no spoilers)  Judy(a rabbit) want to become a police officer but she struggles to become one because she is a rabbit. Then she puts her reputation on a case and is forced to work with a fox. There is a general stereotype in the movie that foxes suck. Then they go on an adventure, and I'm gonna stop talking cause i don't want to spoil anything. One thing that I loved about the movie was the lack of political correctness, this makes the movie really interesting and even adds a few layers to the plot. Like for real in this movie there are drugs, politics, etc. Not to mention I also love that godfather reference. The movie at times is also pretty funny, by no means is it a comedy movie but there are some scenes which can also make adult viewers laugh. The plot is rich and multilayered. The ending is quite great, with all the scandals and twists and turns.

&amp;#x200B;

The characters are also really great. I'll only go into Judy(The Rabbit) and Nick(The Fox) but there are many other decently developed characters in this film. Judy is great, her obviously suffering to prove herself. As I mentioned, she wants to be a cop but she can't because there is a stereotype that ""prey"" can't be cops. During the first act of the movie there are some pretty sad scenes where she is basically bullied, and she even gets demotivated from her own parents.  On the other hand I think that Nick is developed even better than Judy. Basically they show how he isn't naturally an asshole. They show some really sad and almost heartbreaking flashbacks to his childhood. The ending scenes together really  show how these two characters have developed the most tho.  But again I don't want to spoil.

&amp;#x200B;

The setting is nice. Seeing the first sights of Zootopia make you think that this is basically a fantasy land. But it's not, and that's something which the characters have to learn together when going on their mission. It's almost a dystopia in a sense. When they go see all of the things in Zootopia that aren't shown to all the people the setting becomes even more interesting, especially with all of the scandals, political actions, and a bunch of other stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

These are why I think that Zootopia is the best Disney animated movie.",movies,1600728725,PranjalC,True,1,0,2020-09-21

Tenet - An issue I can't resolve,"Major TENET Spoilers ahead

.  

.  

.  

..Ok, so I finally watched Tenet this past weekend. And while I don't think it's of the calibre of Inception or Interstellar, it's a decent addition to Nolan's filmography, and I appreciated the complexity of the concept. 

That said, I'm wondering if I lack some understanding of a particular motivation in the film. It stood out while watching, but I let it pass expecting clarity later on. I'm interested to see if anyone else picked up on this, or potentially has a clearer explanation:  

The basic premise is that the humans of the future see the humans of the 21st Century (us) as the bringers of the Global environmental disaster they are forced to live with, and thus decide to destroy us all using the Algorithm. The scientist who creates the Algorithm is riddled with guilt at it's potential for destruction, especially because she operates on the idea that destroying us (their ancestors) will cause a chain reaction and destroy the future also - one answer to the grandfather paradox.  

And from what I gathered, the evil future folk believe in branch realities, so they think that destroying us in the past will not destroy them at all - i.e you can kill your grandfather and survive still.

And therein lies my issue - If you believe that you can alter the past without erasing your own existence, because it will simply create a branch reality and not affect your own, then how would you (in the future) benefit from those changes? How would the destruction of the 21st century population prevent Global Warming from worsening if this new corpse-filled world exists in a branch reality? Are we meant to think they expected the world around them to magically heal while they stayed intact? Did they believe the future would become inverted and they could live backwards lives in a world that grows healthier the further back they go? I've watched some breakdowns since my viewing, but no one seems to be addressing this directly.

I have no idea why parasite won these awards until this day and tbh i am baffled,"I didn't like this movie nor found it artistic at all whatsoever.  I am completely out of the loop. I watched it and had to exit the movie before the ending. 

Heres another funny story regarding this movie and which is a major occidence one of my close friends was exactly like that and we had to talk him out of it. He disliked paying for things and always found a way to get things for free and he would go to extreme lengths sometimes going to places where they give free breakfast and he was not broke at all but just wanted to live for free but honestly it was disgusting behaviour and ripping off people who want to help the needy. 

But all in all back to parasite honestly I have no idea why they showered awards with this movie.

Spree (2020),"I watched Spree last night and while I can't deny the films power I'm kinda mixed on it.  I commend it to a point: I feel like it achieved what it set out to. But I gotta wonder what the point of it all is. Don't get me wrong: It's not particularly subtle and the film's message is obvious in the first half hour. From there on it's just relentless, brutal horror scene by scene and I think that's probably part of the point: Perhaps testing how numb we've become as a society to the horrors we see on online. But I wonder what the point of it all is in the grander scheme of things. What does a film like this contribute to society really? It's certainly not entertainment. The social commentary is nothing new or bold. It's such a cold view of human nature and if anything is an oversimplification of the lure of fame and social media. But then maybe the point is this: To just get people talking, debating, reviewing their own relationship with social media. 

The one good thing about it that should be beyond debate is Joe Keery's performance. It could have fallen into caricature at any moment but he gives that scary motherfucker layers upon layers. It's why he's so horrifying. He's real. We've seen guys like him online. The desperation and bravado. The constant awareness of the camera. Yet there's also something dead in his eyes. He's hypnotic. Even when there's passengers in his car you're still watching him. It's an astonishing performance and I would assume Keery will be in awards contention come the time.

Interested to see what the consensus is here on the film.",movies,1600733485,HiMyNameIsLaura,True,1,1,2020-09-21

Slender Man (2018),"This is a cheap, cash-grabby teen horror flick in the same vein as the similarly maligned Bye-Bye Man. I’ll say this: it could have been worse. Indeed, the script and dialogue are pretty inane, the characters are bland and uninteresting, and 80% or so of the scares are masses of weird, incoherent, non-scary CGI. But it’s not a complete and utter trainwreck. The cinematography is actually half-decent. It has a nice gray tone that works well for the story and some shot compositions are well-done. There’s also some scares in the first half that are actually somewhat creepy since they don’t just throw CG at you nonstop. Plus, &gt;!the shot of the protagonist fading into the tree at the end!&lt; is actually slightly disturbing and convincing in my opinion, despite how stupid the idea and subsequent ending are.

HELP: Need a movie with communication barrier/difficulties,"Hi all, this is my first time here in r/movies. 

I'm a college resident advisor and am trying to come up with a movie matching my theme for my house this year. I'm going for a theme about being physically distant, but socially connected, so I thought finding a movie featuring a language barrier or a plot where characters have to figure out how to communicate with each other in unconventional ways would fit nicely. 

Let me be more specific: I'm looking for preferably an animated work where the characters communicate in unusual ways. Language barriers/aliens and humans meeting/robots and humans meeting, etc. would be perfect, but I'd prefer to stay away from movies like ""Five Feet Apart"" where the characters have to hang out/communicate differently due to an illness. This is supposed to be light-hearted and a way to remind my residents that even through remote learning, we can still connect with each other in unexpected ways. I also don't really want the movie to be romantic, but I'm considering WALL-e as an option so maybe just err on the side of friendship rather than a true romance. 

Any advice/suggestions pointing me in the right direction would be absolutely appreciated. Thanks in advance, reddit &lt;3",movies,1600739371,shiisneckdeep,True,1,0,2020-09-21

A lot of the puzzles in the quest felt pretty easy to guess like going backwards on a race track instead of going forward. I haven't read the book the movie is based on, but from what I've heard, it's not that good and that the movie is actually an improvement. I don't hate Ready Player One.

All sports movies should take a note of the last scene in Moneyball.,"Was just watching this movie again last night and was reminded how the final scene with the homerun was perfectly executed.  Most sports movies (even based on true events) love to exaggerate what happened and make the final scene sooooo corny, you almost want to throw up.  The stupid commentary (what commentators talk like that anyway), constant cuts to other people watching the game, cuts to the wife and kids, kid saying something like ""is daddy gonna win today"", close up zoom of the coach whispering ""c'mon kid, believe in yourself"", and then the shots of everyone celebrating.  The wife hugging the kids now, everyone celebrating in the commentators box.  Commentator also saying something dumb like ""and the Oakland Athletics have done it.  What an amazing story.  They came back from behind, everyone had written then off, but they said not today"".  As if we didn't just watch the whole movie.  And then some shots of the evil guys from the other team who were always mean and their coach losing it.  Also usually the main player pointing to the sky to his father who passed away like a week before the big game or something.    


Moneyball cut out all that shit and filmed that scene so perfectly and kept it all about the game   nothing else.  As I was watching it, it kinda hit me how different it was from other sports movie finales.  Leading up to the big moment, there's no unnecessary chatter.  No corny words from the announcers, no shots of family members (they coulve easily shown hattebergs family or Billy's family or something, biting their nails).  It's eerily quiet, other than sound of the crowd.  It makes you feel like you really are at the ballpark or watching the game live.  As the viewer, You know the situation, you know what's at stake, you don't need a constant reminder from a secondary character talking about it or some overly forced summary from the announcer.      

And the actual moment was just amazing.  The resounding ""thwack"" of the bat, and then complete silence as everyone watches the ball.  If you're a sports fan and you've ever sat through a game like that, you know that feeling.  When it feels like time has stopped or slowed down and your heart is in your throat.  Only takes a second for you to realize it's going over the board's but that split second where you don't know if they've done it feels like an eternity.  The recreated that moment perfectly without overdoing it.

And then just beautiful music.  

Also something amazing I felt was the use of actual footage and how it was generally shown on a tv.  Or when you could hear commentary it was because a character was watching it on the tv or listening to the radio.  Not because it was being played over the game as we watched it.  

This movie feels like it was made by a sports fan and for the sports fans.  I wish more sports movies were like this instead of being made by Disney.",movies,1600740006,draft_wagon,True,1,0,2020-09-21

"Which ""classic"" American movie (pre-1965) makes you want to be a better person?","For me, I often turn to Casablanca when my sadness outweighs my anger. It's a movie primarily about sacrifice -- for your country, for a loved one, for whatever goodness you support that's bigger than yourself. Blaine starts off as a kind of smart-aleck who's licked his wounds and hides behind a shield of cynicism (and liquor). Then the love of his life -- who left him stunned in the rain, having his guts kicked out as he waited for a train -- returns, and he drinks and pouts until he realizes he needs to do the right thing, no matter how much it hurts. 

These days, it's hard to tell what the right thing is -- especially in an environment where we're so physically limited by what we can and cannot do. It echoes World War II-torn Europe in strikingly prescient ways. I could go for another Casablanca rewatch, but I already know how that movie ends.

Tom Hardy should play Quasimodo if Disney does a live action of Hunchback Of Notre Dame,"This popped into my head a few weeks ago talking to my best friend and fellow movie nerd. He said immediately, “dude what a call...”. And the more I think about him in all his roles, I think it would be an amazing choice. Aside from the age difference of the projected ~20 year old protagonist, I wouldn’t even think about it because I feel like he would be enveloping in that role. All the little moments in his movies, his facial ticks, mouth manipulation, very emotional facial expressions; these just sing the same characteristics of Quasimodo’s spirit and complicated character.

My first Benson and Moorehead film.,"Since I've been super excited for Synchronic, I have made it my priority to watch their three previous film before it releases in October. First up was Resolution. Overall a pretty strange movie with an extremely clever script. I'm basically just going to point out things I enjoyed. First up, the humor. For what I expected to be a horror film, there was definetly a few laugh out loud moments. Now, I don't know if this was intentional or not but just the entire scenario of a guy handcuffing his junkie friend to a pipe for days on end makes for some great comedic potential. I also really enjoyed cameos from both Aaron and Justin playing fictionalized versions of themselves (Like in The Endless.) I like that it left me with a lot of questions. These guys really treat their audience with respect and don't spoon feed them any information. Also for their first feature film, the cast is extremely solid. Everyone felt convincing and did a very good job. They felt like people that I could meet in real life. Overall, Resolution was an extremely fun time and I'm very excited to see what other surprises Benson and Moorehead have in store for me. I'll be reviewing Spring next!
