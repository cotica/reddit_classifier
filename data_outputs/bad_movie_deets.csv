日本藤素幫助演員阮海“喚醒”房間的激烈表演," 

已經使用了許多產品來改善男性生理健康，但演員阮海（Nguyen Hai）仍無法按預期恢復其正常的房事能力，進入岡本藥妝店並使用[日本藤素](https://okabuy.com/)後，他使用頭10天就取得了積極的成果。

## 演員阮海使用[日本藤素](https://okabuy.com/)之前的身體情況

\[caption id=""attachment\_757"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""768""\]📷 日本藤素 演員阮海腰痛\[/caption\]

63歲的演員阮海面臨男性生理功能的明顯下降。具體而言，演員經常陷入“還沒開始就結束了”的狀態，使得與妻子的戀愛變得快速而乏味。“*我知道這個年齡段任何人都有這項困擾，但是我有點震驚。誰會想到幾年前我仍然像個“年輕人”，而現在卻可憐不知所措呢？作為一個忙於工作的人，經常被安排去外地上班，所以我非常感謝在家中與妻子團聚的日子。然而，每天到了晚上的時候，“槍支”被卡住，非常尷尬*”

在談到這種生理機能障礙時，藝術家阮海說，主要原因是年齡的增長。隨之而來的是忙碌的工作，密集的拍攝時間表，飲食，休息...

“*正是那些壓力和長期壓力的日子使我無法保持自己的黃金年齡。取而代之的是，樂趣不斷縮短，時間縮短然後次數稀疏。儘管有時候我想和我的妻子在一起，但是身體無法配合，所以我忍不住感到無助，”男演員阮海說*。

除了男性生理功能下降外，演員阮海也有一些不愉快的症狀，如多次夜尿，背部疼痛，膝蓋疲勞……這使他無法入睡。長時間的症狀對演員的健康，工作和心理造成負面影響：

“在那些日子裡，我想我會調養的越來越好的，但是卻讓我不僅在床事上“無力”，而且健康狀況也在不斷下降，所以說無論您多麼熱愛這份工作，都想獻身於這份工作，想給聽眾帶來良好的作用，但是如果您沒有健康，就無法做到。 疾病日復一日地纏著，使我周圍的妻子和親戚更加擔心。看到人們為我煩躁不安，我承認這很傷我，我不知道怎麼做！”

## 使用各種在市場上標榜“效果很好”“一顆見效”的產品，但無濟於事

面對“過山坡”式的生理虛弱，演員阮海考慮使用西藥或在互聯網上刊登廣告的某些功能性產品。阮海認為這些產品是“神聖的”用途的介紹，這可以幫助我擺脫對“虛弱”的恐懼，取而代之的是，我越努力，就越失望。但是，事實並非演員所期望的那樣，而且結局太丟臉；

“*為了快速起見，我選擇使用威爾剛產品，以及其他類似產品全部使用。但是這些產品僅具有立竿見影的效果。總的來說，它還能幫助男人“保持勃起”更長的時間，但是之後，他們會感到非常疲倦，身體呆滯，疲憊並且沒有活力。更不用說下次我想要達到這種性能時，我必須繼續使用該產品。* 

*事實證明，這些產品都使人們依賴該藥物並引起一些不良副作用。輕度使使用者頭痛，頭昏眼花，重度會導致永久性勃起功能障礙，陰莖不再能夠“立正站好”。想到這一點，我現在仍然感到恐慌*”

## 演員阮海直接去[岡本藥妝店](https://okabuy.com/)接受諮詢和治療方案

考慮到一些在市場上廣為宣傳的男性增強產品的副作用，演員阮海繼續努力尋找解決生理上無力的難題的解決方案。幸運的是，在拍攝期間的休息時間與同事的交談中，同事推薦了岡本藥妝店！分享了其網站（https://okabuy.com/）；據演員阮海說，已研究並聯繫了該藥店，以諮詢和檢查他所患有的生理疾病。

\[caption id=""attachment\_758"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""768""\]📷 日本藤素演員阮海資訊醫師\[/caption\]

經過仔細的檢查，醫師指示我在3個月內使用[日本藤素](https://okabuy.com/)的療法，這是50歲以上老人的最佳建議。另外，我還加入了療程治療法，以加倍影響，使恢復過程更快。

### 在使用[日本藤素](https://okabuy.com/)的前十天，“威猛的我”回來了

經過醫生的全面檢查和諮詢，演員阮海服用了[日本藤素](https://okabuy.com/)進入治療階段，除了按時和按要求的劑量使用產品外，還精心結合科學飲食和健康活動使結果更理想。

岡本藥妝店的[日本藤素](https://okabuy.com/)是一種東方醫藥產品，因此具有“溫養”的特性，使用者需要長時間堅持不懈地才能看到效果。但是，對於那些極有可能吸收藥物的人來說，僅5-10天后，當營養成分被吸收到體內時，它們就會開始起作用。

“*我經常出現夜間排尿，背部疼痛和膝蓋疲勞的情況已得到明顯緩解。因此，我感覺進食、睡眠、精神的恢復，而且我的身體也更加舒暢。特別是，我與妻子“運動”的時間也大大延長了，從現在的2-3分鐘延長到5-7分鐘。* 

*我相信目前只用了幾天時間，身體給我的反饋是有明顯的改善，如果我按照醫師的建議堅持所有3個療程，那“年輕的我”肯定會回來的，我和我妻子之間的性快感將不再面臨任何問題 ！*”

## [日本藤素](https://okabuy.com/)的強大力量：現代男性的解決方案“比黃金更珍貴”

[日本藤素](https://okabuy.com/)是由日本國家藥物研究與應用中心成功開發的有助於解決男性生理問題的產品。該產品完全繼承了日本的精髓，並繼承了來自該領域領先專家的醫生團隊進行的現代深入科學研究。

傳統中藥材通過按照一定的黃金比例分離和組合藥物成分的多個階段，研究人員成功地生產出了具有以下5種功能的[日本藤素](https://okabuy.com/)：幫助雕刻修復腎臟損傷、腎臟虛弱、多次消除夜間排尿症狀、背部疼痛、膝蓋疲勞...針對男性生理問題的男性產品，例如：早洩、勃起功能障礙、功能受損和性慾...

[日本藤素](https://okabuy.com/)的成分出現了稀有的東方草藥，這些草藥被稱為男性生理問題的“破局者”，三種主要成分：人參，赤根草，雄鹿鞭，當這些草藥滲透到體內深處時，將有助於男性“根治症狀，破壞源頭”的困擾。

## 演員阮海對[日本藤素](https://okabuy.com/)的治療結果感到非常滿意

\[caption id=""attachment\_759"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""768""\]📷 日本藤素幫助演員阮海“喚醒”房間的激烈表演\[/caption\]

此外，經過一段時間的使用，從符合GACP-WHO標準的100％清潔天然草藥中提取的這些成分還有助於滋養男性身體，產生骨髓益處並變得健康。堅韌，健康，清爽的精神，支持增加身體的抵抗力並顯著改善身體的免疫系統。

因此，[日本藤素](https://okabuy.com/)不僅被認為是幫助克服男性生理問題的珍寶，而且還是幫助您提高業績和恢復尊嚴的“萬能鑰匙”。像二十歲一樣的有自信！

目前，“[日本藤素](https://okabuy.com/)”已經通過了衛生部的嚴格審查，並獲得了在全球范圍內發行的許可。由於其對治療男性生理問題的積極貢獻，[日本藤素](https://okabuy.com/)在電視節目，報紙，久負盛名的網站上經常被提及；如果你要使用一種方案解決房事困，在使用10天后喚醒像演員**阮海**這樣的勇猛，請與岡本藥妝店聯繫，以獲取建議和支持，直接治療。",shittymoviedetails,1606462548,ThoughtWilling9097,True,1,5,2020-11-26

So yesteday I've been watching some David Icke, and although i am feeling more like a reptillian than human (I can't really say that I feel as innocent as a gnostic human being that is, although what roman empire did to the library of alexandria is kinda un-forgivable in a way, despite perhaps there was a reason for why they did - maybe they have seen the future timelines of people (either reptiles killing humans or the other way, and for the prosperity of the citizens of the earth -&gt; human interbreeding involved for highest rate of prosperity in terms of genetical superiority for the galactic empire-&gt; they choose to just scan the whole library of alexandria and sent it to the moon-which is hollow, but didn't have to be that way from the beginning-maybe it was just a little planetary rock, like there could be someone like Elon Musk in the past flying there, while at that time still being just a little rock and building the moon from within on the top of that rock, spreading multiple building bases all arrround it, taking 100s if not thousands of years theoretically-&gt; what may one call 2000 years of stagnation ( we started brutally developing since industrial revolution,but meanwhile we were dummies kinda like we have been pumping sumthing gradually from the angels, or rather being fed, than given the knowledge (that could be ours and deserved). untill it started looking naturally for the people of our age, to assume that the moon is real natural phenomenon of the real universe.

I’ve always loved the distinct works of **Hayao Miyazaki**, so I thought I’d use my tech skills to visualize why his movies are so pretty.

First I took my Blu Ray of **Castle in the Sky**, and with a script extracted all the frames from the movie.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a447m0nup5251.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c22da37b7b05f347074162377be052e100528f3

The script will compress every frame of the movie into one single pixel, like this:

&amp;#x200B;

You can see how in this frame the dominating colors are green and blue. After extracting 5000 frames from the whole movie, we get something like this:

You can already see how colorful the movie is. With some Photoshop manipulation, I turned this *barcode* into two different visualizations: **Warp** and **Circular**.

Then I put them into posters or stickers.

I did the same process for ***Spirited Away***, another **Studio Ghibli** movie, and it is as colorful as ever:

Rajinikanth is leading in Petta back to Badshaa Style," 

![img](3ry35onbkr921)

If we go by the million [Rajinikanth](https://onlinemovies4you.com/) jokes powering online sites, Thalaivar can do anything. Stopping and reversing time, it seems, is a breeze for the star. The doubters need to buy tickets for [Petta](https://onlinemovies4you.com/) where director Karthik Subbaraj ‘Rajinifies’ you with cigarette flicks and deep throaty laughs. There is that signature sunglass flick too – it is officially 90s again and we are here to partake in this fan feast.

Karthik called his film a celebration of everything Rajinikanth, and that is exactly how it plays from its first frame to the last – specially the climactic frame. Petta is a film made by a Rajinikanth fan, for Rajinikanth fans.

“Vayasanalum, un style um azhagum, unna vitta pogala (Even though you have grown older, your style and beauty has not left you),” said Neelambari in Rajinikanth’s Padayappa and in Peetta’s entry scene, with his signature deep laugh, it does feel we are back in time. This feat is achieved not just by the superstar, but by the entire cast and crew. From the title card, to the songs that Rajini loves to listen on his old radio – it is pure nostalgia packaged as a film.

Lightning McQueen is a statutory rapist,"Epic Film Fact: 
Lightning McQueen, star of the 2006 blockbuster film ""Cars"" is a statutory rapist. 
In the film Lightning meets and falls in love with a car named Sally Carrera, a 2002 Porsche 911. This makes Sally only 4 years old during the film (which takes place in 2006). Lightning on the other hand is a stock car and while his age isn't expressly given, we know that an average stock car can race for 20 to 30 years. Because lightning is the best we can assume that he is 30 years old at the end of ""Cars 3"", which takes place in 2017, 11 years after ""Cars"". This would make Lightning 19 years old when he meets Sally.

The 2015 film Jurassic World avoids having feathered dinosaurs by re-using a plot device from the 1993 film Jurassic Park.,"Since the 1993 film was released, new scientific discoveries have revealed that many dinosaurs may have actually been feathered.

As most fellow film buffs will recall, that's also why a dinosaur in the first movie changed sex in order to get laid. Dinos aren't gay, but they can be trans.",shittymoviedetails,1499367426,ineversaidbatman,True,8,0,2017-07-06

Purpose of earphones and music in baby driver?,"So this may be a stretch but early in the film Kevin Spacey's character tells the group that Baby was in an accident when he was young and that his ears constantly ring and tells the group that he listens to music to drown it out.

What do you think?",shittymoviedetails,1500099221,LordCommanderBunny,True,11,3,2017-07-14
