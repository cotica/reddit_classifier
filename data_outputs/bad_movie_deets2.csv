movie pitch,"I kinda know that this completely doesn't fit here, but nonetheless since it's 2020, I think this movie which hasn't been released could slip into this category think of it as an adaptation theory pitch for the presentation/movie of David Icke : The lion sleeps no more.

So yesteday I've been watching some David Icke, and although i am feeling more like a reptillian than human (I can't really say that I feel as innocent as a gnostic human being that is, although what roman empire did to the library of alexandria is kinda un-forgivable in a way, despite perhaps there was a reason for why they did - maybe they have seen the future timelines of people (either reptiles killing humans or the other way, and for the prosperity of the citizens of the earth -&gt; human interbreeding involved for highest rate of prosperity in terms of genetical superiority for the galactic empire-&gt; they choose to just scan the whole library of alexandria and sent it to the moon-which is hollow, but didn't have to be that way from the beginning-maybe it was just a little planetary rock, like there could be someone like Elon Musk in the past flying there, while at that time still being just a little rock and building the moon from within on the top of that rock, spreading multiple building bases all arrround it, taking 100s if not thousands of years theoretically-&gt; what may one call 2000 years of stagnation ( we started brutally developing since industrial revolution,but meanwhile we were dummies kinda like we have been pumping sumthing gradually from the angels, or rather being fed, than given the knowledge (that could be ours and deserved). untill it started looking naturally for the people of our age, to assume that the moon is real natural phenomenon of the real universe.
