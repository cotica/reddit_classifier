       "I watched this earlier today and I am surprised at how the movie is. I had zero interest in the movie when I saw the trailers, even though it starred Tom Holland and Will Smith in the leading roles. It just didn't look that good but I was wrong. The movie is a delight, it's funny and the premise is interesting. It's also pushing it's PG rating to the limit since it's actually quite violent, it hints at cuss word and at one point there was a bleep to cover a cuss word. There's also a few sexual innuendos thrown in there aswell. At one point Tom Holland's character makes a \"50 Shades of Grey\" reference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
