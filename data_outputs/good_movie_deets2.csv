Mortal Kombat (2021) has a fight scene in a trailer home between &lt;spoiler&gt; and &lt;spoiler&gt;. The scene is meant to mirror the trailer fight scene in Kill Bill Vol 2.,"The mortal kombat fight is between Sonya and Kano, didn't want to leave spoilers in the title.

Both scenes take place in a trailer home. Both scenes involve fighting a one-eyed (arguably, in the case of kano)  sociopathic bad guy. Both scenes have a similar bathroom fight sequence. Both scenes involve the bad guy getting stabbed in the eye at the end.

I'm pretty sure I haven't really listed half the similarities, because I haven't compared them side by side. Pretty sure if you did, there would be a lot more.

I was going to call the Mortal Kombat fight sequence an 'homage' to the kill bill one, but when I googled it I found that the two movies share a producer in Bennet Walsh, so I'm not sure 'homage' is the right word -- he couldn't be paying homage to himself, right?",MovieDetails,1619336854,ambisinister_gecko,True,1,3,2021-04-25

The car chases in Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) happen in the same place,"Source: I watched both movies being filmed directly  outside my apartment, and the street signs are mostly accurate in the films and trailers

‚Äî‚Äî

Don‚Äôt know if this means something as far as the plot lines of the film goes, or if it‚Äôs just trivia because this area of SF is photogenic and maybe permits are easy to get there, but both of these films‚Äô climatic chase scenes were filmed in the same place. 

In Ant-Man and the Wasp, the chase goes east down California street, though some was actually filmed on Bush, before eventually turning south/downhill on Mason street - when Ant-Man goes large and ‚Äúskateboards‚Äù downhill on a large truck, that‚Äôs the intersection of Bush and Mason. You can see the bar Summer Place (RIP) in the background, the building with the rock facade, so google that for a map view.

We can see in the Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings trailer that the action - the chase scenes in the SF city bus - again takes place east to west on California and Bush, and that‚Äôs how I saw it filmed. We can see this time that the bus turns south from California on Stockton, not Mason. Also, in the trailer shots of a hotel with a red BMW parked out front, that‚Äôs the Fairmont hotel, two blocks north of the Bush &amp; Mason intersection mentioned earlier. 

I was able to see much of this filming from my window, friends saw even more. There‚Äôs a shot not in the trailer where construction workers are set up in the middle of the street, but they have to bail out as a car comes crashing through - that was filed in the Bush &amp; Mason intersection, and custom camera cars were ripping east on Bush and turning down Mason for a few days in a row. They even had a fake bus that was just a shell over a race car, it was wild. 

So I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a story-driven reason for these two films to share this same location, or if Marvel is just comfortable producing chases on these particular streets, but maybe there‚Äôs an Easter Egg buried in here somewhere? I‚Äôm no Marvel expert. 

If this isn‚Äôt ‚Äúproven‚Äù enough, I have video of the production, I can hopefully post that if necessary.",MovieDetails,1618882840,mistersmith_22,True,1,12,2021-04-19

One Of My Top Favorite Zombies In Dawn of the Dead (2004),"&amp;#x200B;

[Every single time I re-watch this film and see her, I get a bit on edge.](https://preview.redd.it/plaaixl23ot61.jpg?width=479&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6a5ae266d5555ed82a444173404c15ca474b82b)

This bug-eyed zombie, a white brunette with unkempt hair and blood or dirt on her forehead (It's hard to tell from the scene's color filter) can be seen in a very brief blink-and-you'll-miss-it shot. She's captured running toward the camera for 1-2 seconds at most during the 3rd act, when the horde chases the survivors as they attempt to escape the infested city. That face has stayed with me for years, ever since I first saw the *Dawn of the Dead* remake when I was between 13-14 years old.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if it's the wide eyes or that she looks almost normal compared to the other ghouls, but something about her expression unsettles me more than most of the other featured onscreen zombies. Often times, the most unnerving undead from my POV, be it in movies, TV, games or other media, are the *""fresh""* ones (i.e. the most human looking). Ex- Zombie Luis. It provokes this Uncanny Valley effect where I know this is a person but something feels off (The animalistic shrieking certainly adds to that). So, naturally, the closer it gets to the camera, the more uncomfortable I become.

&amp;#x200B;

It's definitely not my favorite zombie makeup of the film. That honor goes hands down to the [zombie with exposed skull](https://rottenink.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/dawn-of-the-dead-2004-5.png), who Andre encounters shortly after the group first enters &amp; explores the mall (My second favorite is [zombie-](https://pm1.narvii.com/6851/419d82e258a944490fc8ec088b07d40b10c05601v2_hq.jpg)[Vivian](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DAnhk6_XkAE5BKW.jpg)). I've tried to find casting info. in the past on who this was, but came up empty. There were A LOT of extras playing zombies in this movie, after all. If I had to guess, this was not one of the ""hero"" zombies (The ones with the most detailed makeups meant to be at the forefront in group shots). Rather, she was one of the background ghouls who just happened to be caught in the footage. In this instance though, I'd say that worked to the film's advantage.

Prisoners (2013) and Why the RV was there.,"In Prisoners (2013), Detective Loki begins investigating the abduction of two girls in Thanksgiving.

Earlier, before the two girls were abducted, they climbed onto an RV that was parked with the engine on and someone being inside, before one of the girls brothers takes them away.

When the police investigate the disappearance of the girls, the aforementioned brother mentions the RV and shows his Dad where it was parked. Later, it is mentioned that all of the family members gave their statements to police.

Detective Loki investigates the RV and is seen visiting the location the brother said it was parked. Looking at the house it was parked by, he finds a news article stating that a child was abducted while playing in the front lawn years ago. He notices the mother has since moved from the house, and actually pays her a visit, where she mentions that she is sure that the same person who took her son took the two girls, which is later shown to be correct.

We later find out that woman's son is Alex Jones, the driver of the RV who was abducted as a child by Holly Jones, who abducted the two girls. He owned the RV and was parked outside his childhood home,  which can imply he was looking for his true origins. Remember that Alex, who has the IQ of a ten-year old states while he is being tortured by Keller that he is ""not really Alex"".",MovieDetails,1618443363,RhinoJew,True,1,8,2021-04-14

[Zack Snyder's Justice League 2021] In Victor's vision of the Knightmare timeline we see...,"...the Joker's card that he offers to Batman as part of a truce later in the fim, in **Batman's** vision of the Knightmare timeline. Joker says that as long as Batman has the card the truce stands, but if he rips the card the truce is over and they can discuss 'why Bruce sent a boy wonder to do a man's job' (what a **great** line!). Anyway...

&amp;#x200B;

In **Cyborg's** vision the card is now torn and Superman is holding Batman's cowl, potentially implying that Joker could betray Batman in the Knightmare even after forming the truce (shocker!)

This is the presumably the same card we see taped to Batman's gun in the BvS Knightmare, and the Superman shot is a different take on a shot we see in one of the trailers from 2020:

Discussion. Perfume: The Story of a Murderer. (2006).,"Hello!  
Sorry if im not following posting formats. I watched Perfume the story of a murderer for the first time today and it blew my mind. Specially with the ending of the movie. I have a theory and I wanted to hear some thoughts about it or if anyone agrees with it. When Jean-Baptiste starts learning the art of making perfumes from his master, he tells him a story about creating a perfume, adding with a small tale or legend at the end. This part is located at around minute 46 of the movie.

The story says that a perfume has 3 parts (with 4 fragrances each), the head which is the first impression and lasts for a couple of minutes, the heart which is the true ""feel"" of the perfume and finally the base, the trail that lasts several days. Then he goes on to talk about an ancient egypt legend that a true original perfume has one more note, one more fragrance to make a truly special perfume. When opening the pharaohs tomb, a perfume so strong was released but of said perfume only 12 notes could be differentiated, losing the 13th note forever.

Now when Jean finishes his life work he had killed a total of 13 girls to make the perfume. And on the last 20 minutes of the movie a series of sequences are played. The head of the perfume he made, the revelation of him being an ""angel"" discovered to everyone in the plaza. Then the heart that lasts hour, a heart of ""love"" that strikes so strong the father of one of the girls ends up recognizing him as his own son. Then the trail, the ""desire"" of the people for Jean's body, which ends up with his death by cannibalism and finally that last note, that falls into the muddy fish market, marking the end of a true original perfume lost forever, the original smell of Jean, that was born without one.",MovieDetails,1613193746,Suuwegu,True,1,5,2021-02-12

Now I don't know if this is completely coincidental, and there are only so many ways you could stage an elephant battle, or if someone used this part of that book to help sketch out the scene, but I thought it was at least quite interesting.

They stifled the men with their trunks, or else snatching them up from the ground delivered them over their heads to the soldiers in the towers; with their tusks they disembowelled them, and hurled them into the air, and long entrails hung from their ivory fangs like bundles of rope from a mast.*

"1408 (2007) features a misleading homage to Misery (1990), another Stephen King adaptation.","At the end of Misery, Paul has dinner with his agent, Marcia. At the restaurant, he images he sees his tormentor Annie alive again, and coming towards him. But he comes to his senses, and sees that it's just a waitress. Then the film ends.

1408 has a false ending roughly 80 minutes into the film where 1408 creates a convincing false reality for Mike where he wakes up on the beach half-drowned in a repeat of the opening act, is reconciled with his father as well as his wife, Lily. He is writing a book about his terrifying dream of Room 1408. Taking Lily to dinner, Mike thinks he sees one of the maids killed by 1408, walking towards him in the  restaurant. Then he sees it's a completely different woman. 

Because the film is closing on 90 minutes, this works to lull the audience into believing the lie that Mike is safe and well, if disturbed by his ""dream"" of 1408. The film is cleverly reaching a plausible ending runtime, and the scene strongly resembles the final scene from another Stephen King-adaptation. This is an example of a film purposefully using a homage to mislead the audience. Anti-foreshadowing, perhaps.

"Inglorious Basterds (2009) Hans Landa is wearing a medal that shows he participated in the beer hall putsch in the 20s, and has been a party member since then, long before most people even knew what a Nazi was. This suggests his pretenses not to be ideological and merely an opportunist are a ploy.","To be clear, I think he is also an opportunist. But he oversells that aspect of himself once it becomes clear the Nazis have lost the war.

He isn't just a Nazi. He's one of the first Nazis.

IMO this is a great movie detail because most people completely buy the way he presents himself and think he's merely pretending to be ideological and fooling the nazis. That he's ""Just an amoral detective"" and the nazis employ him to detect Jews. The presence of this medal indicates that he is fooling those people into thinking he's fooling the nazis, but unless you know how to recognize a Nazi and know what to look for, his disguise works. People assume he's an ""Opportunist"" because he convincingly sells himself as one.

"Kelly in Cast Away (2000) moved on from Chuck relatively quickly despite saying ""I always knew you were alive"".","**This timeline is based on my just now rewatching the movie. Some details may not be dead on balls accurate. 

Ok so Tom Hank's character was gone for 4 years according to the timeline given. His family was pressuring him to marry Helen Hunt's character early in the movie so its easy to assume they had been together a while.

By the time he was rescued, his girlfriend and future wife (probably) had moved on, gotten married and had a child that was around a year old based on the small amount of time she is on the screen.

It is stated that they looked for Chuck for months (I think?) after the crash and I'm gonna guess that's 3-4. Once they called off the search and organized the funeral its realistic to think that it was 5-6 months after the crash. 

If you figure the year in age of the baby, the 9 months she was pregnant the around 6 months from crash to the funeral, that's almost 2 and a half years. It's assumed that they had the baby after they got married but I don't recall them ever saying one way or another.

If she dated that dude for even 6 months to a year before they got married that means that there was only an 8-12ish month gap between the funeral and her beginning to date again. For a person that you love enough to consider marrying to die so suddenly that seems like a short turnaround to date again doesn't it?

I mean I get that people deal complex emotions in different ways and rebounding may have been the right thing, especially since she states that everyone was telling her to move on, but I would have a really hard time telling my friend to move on and try to start a new relationship in what may have been the same calendar year since their loved one's funeral.",MovieDetails,1611494960,effingthingsucks,True,1,1,2021-01-24

I‚Äôm Thinking of Ending Things (2020) This is my idea of an insanely confusing film. Waning: This contains SPOILERS so go ahead and finish this film before reading!!,"I believe people forget to mention why Lucy keeps egging on about the thoughts of ending this nonexistent relationship. If this is meant to be an idealized girlfriend, then there‚Äôd be no need for her to feel uneasy about moving on from Jake. That could mean two things: Jake originally planned to stop living in his own thoughts of the past and just face reality. Or: This movie is about Jake tragically facing the truth but having an inability to live on. 

The scene with Jake‚Äôs parents could represent his final goodbye‚Äôs with them. This entire interaction holds so many contradictions, but what I want to focus on is the mom mistaking Jake‚Äôs 20th birthday to be his 50th. Jake could‚Äôve actually been there in the flesh or Jake couldn‚Äôt muster the perfect time to mentally leave his parents. The inconsistencies in Lucy‚Äôs telling of how they first met could support this too. After the runaround of a story, she mentions how Jake finally became a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and ‚Äúfunny‚Äù person.. but that doesn‚Äôt sound like something Jake would be. Jake was working these ideas in real time because everything had to feel right to him. Then Lucy mentions how they‚Äôve been together for only two weeks but feels as though it‚Äôs been far longer. Jake could‚Äôve rehearsed this moment ,or at least the idea of having a girlfriend, for years on end, unable to perfect each sequence. 

Lucy comes to this realization and then plans to officially end things on the staircase. She offers the idea of wanting to ‚Äúmake a clean break‚Äù because ‚Äúhe could only wait for so long‚Äù. At this point, Lucy feels unaware of how much control she has over herself. She feels as if melded to Jake‚Äôs own self. Because that‚Äôs what she is, but it‚Äôs coming to a point where Jake couldn‚Äôt differentiate a false reality from what‚Äôs real. This is made concrete when Lucy sees a picture of Jake as a child. Lucy begins to question Jake‚Äôs past when she thinks ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt it me?‚Äù It also shows how little Lucy has ever mentioned of her family or her own past, because she never used this to relate to Jake in any way besides not knowing who is who. The only person that was ever on her mind was just Jake. Jake is unable to establish a clear sense of character but he no longer cares. He just moves on to the next moment, seeking to find the finale of closing things off with his parents. 

Around the same time later, both Jake and Lucy begin to cry. Jake could‚Äôve finally found reconcilement, even if it be abrupt and short, in departing from his family. For Lucy to cry with unannounced thoughts, that‚Äôs to tell the viewer how connected her and Jake truly are. Too much of Jake was seeping into the figment of what be Lucy.  

Moving on to the final scenes of the movie, Lucy would later on ask herself ‚Äúhow long would it take to die from hypothermia?‚Äù Which sort of foreshadowed Jake‚Äôs untimely death in the final scenes. Lucy would then chase after Jake and traverse through the school. Skipping the dialogue she holds with the janitor, a.k.a Jake talking to himself, she takes part in a dance. Jake ,the janitor, kills this false idea once and for all and then reacts in real time with heavy breaths as he gets ready and moves towards the car. Once inside, Jake puts the keys down and just sits until he goes mad. These are his final moments and he chose this car to be his burial ground. Cutting to the end credits, we see a bright sunny day and snow covering some of the frame. If any moment in this movie can relate to this, it‚Äôd be when the father sees the many paintings of Lucy‚Äôs. He mentions how could he ‚Äúfeel something, if there‚Äôs not a person feeling... sad or joyous‚Äù. Going by the father‚Äôs words, what am I to feel if there‚Äôs no person there? Well, there is. Jake is just hidden in plain sight, covered by the snow on the car. He died of the aforementioned hypothermia after finally cutting ties with his reminders of a false life.

"The opening song in Iron Man (2008), ""Back in Black"" by AC/DC, foreshadows Iron Man's origin.","The movie *Iron Man* (2008) opens to the song, ""Back in Black"" by AC/DC, which foreshadows the main character's (Tony Stark) story line and Iron Man's origin.

The song, ""Back in Black"" is about coming back from the dead with a vengeance. Putting it into perspective, the band had just lost their former lead singer and many felt they'd never again reach the peak they hit with their album, *Highway to Hell*. However, after enlisting the services of Brian Johnson, they released *Back in Black*, with the eponymous title track, and ""came back from the dead"" with a vengeance. 

Likewise, the origin of Iron Man in *Iron Man* sees Tony Stark attacked in the beginning, with many presuming him to be dead after news of the attack broke. Instead, and with some help, he musters up the strength to escape captivity and eventually becomes Iron Man. Later, enacting his vengeance against the people who initially captured him. 

Thus, opening the movie to, ""Back in Black"" and us first seeing Tony Stark while this song is playing, foreshadows the character arc he's about to take.",MovieDetails,1610692796,gnrdmjfan247,True,1,3,2021-01-14

Take a good look of what's Emma stone wearing and when.

On Friday, she wears black blue tank top pr t-shit, we can't be sure because her black piece of clothing covers her shoulders.

On Saturday she wakes up in green pyjammas - in which she stays for most of the day- at least until the afternoon.

In next scene we see her painting, wearing the blue tank top. And it seems likely that is the same blue tank top she wore yesterday. Maybe when she dacided she wants to paint, she changed into it- because didn't want to mess up her PJ's with paint. On the other hand, blue tank top is already needing a wash, so getting some paint on it wouldn't be that big of a deal. That actually seems to be the case, as in next scene, she now longer wears a blue tank top, and dances in the purple one instead.

On Sunday we see her in her green pyjammas again. We can't be sure how long she stays in them (as in the next sceen she wears nothing at all) but it's likely that she wore them for the most of the day again.

She finishes day with showering and then slipping into fresh blue PJ's.",MovieDetails,1610438903,ruski_puskin,True,1,3,2021-01-12

Happy Feet (2006) ¬øWhy Mumble has babyish feathers? Handicap Principle,"I am interested in studying biology someday, so, while reading some animal species stuff I learnt about the Handicap Principle. Its author, Amotz Zahavi proposed to say nature tends to be ""honest"" by signalling problems on an animal morphology. This means that if an animal is sick or born with any condition, his body will warn the other members that that individual is not the best option to copulate.

So, yeah, Mumble clearly has a birth defect. His feathers don't get bright and colorful, because his body is warning the other penguins that he can mess up the lineage. As I said, I'm not a biologist, maybe someone here could refute me.

I don't know if they thought about this while designed Mumble. As far as I know, they only did it like that for being able to recognize him between so many tuxedos, and instead, they gave him just a bow tie. But who knows?

Just now, I was watching the new version of The Secret Garden film (2020) starring Colin firth. While watching, I noticed I guess you could call it an easter egg of a statue from Pan's Labyrinth. Of course there are some slight differences in the details but I am curious if anyone else thinks there may be a reference to Pan's. My theory maybe there is a portal in the secret garden for the princess to return and that is where it gets its magic from. I won't say much more about the movies in case of spoilers for others. Also, this is just for fun I do not claim to know anything, it's just a theory.

tenet review 2020... no spoilers, this my point about tenet .... tenet is the first new film to be released in cinemas in about five months as if a new christopher nolan film wasn't hyped up enough now it's billed to be the savior of cinemas almost overwhelming it moves at a breakneck speed it's full of ideas breathtaking visuals all set to lugwood garrison's fantastic pulsating score it feels like a film that's celebrating the scale and scope of cinema it transports you from one beautiful location to another in the blink of an eye the set pieces are ginormous and done for real which gives the film even during the highest heights of its very high concept a visceral and grounded feeling however oh i didn't love it it's not flawless a lot of people are saying that this is nolan's most complex film yet but i i don't think that's true it doesn't seem any more ambitious than his previous work what i would say is that the storytelling here is kind of clunkier so sometimes even the simpler plot points are difficult to follow i've seen it twice now and i think the first time i watched it i missed one piece of dialogue and i didn't know what they were doing for about 10 minutes like i said everything moves at a breakneck pace and especially on my first watch i felt like it was in a rush to get through it all like it wasn't enjoying itself and i would guess that it's because it's trying to pack a lot in and keep the running time to two and a half hours which is still it's not a short film the action sequences are spectacular to watch i really like nolan's commitment to a subjective point of view he keeps the camera with the characters for a lot of the movie even in some of the more spectacular action sequences like in the car chase arguably it would be more cinematic to cut to an objective point of view or to a more impossible angle which nolan never does he understands that keeping the camera with the characters makes it feel real it makes it feel more dangerous so in order for an action scene to really be effective we need to understand what the stakes are what the character's trying to accomplish otherwise you're just watching stuff happen and in tenet it's not always clear and sometimes it's guilty of spectacle for spectacle's sake when i saw that plane crash in the trailer which they really did by the way just a side note that's amazing i was wondering what the story was going to be in that moment but it kind of is just it's a plane crash it's spectacle which i'm all for you know i like a bit of smashy crashy i'm only human but i do like my spectacle serve with a side of suspense a dash of drama the plane crash the reversing car the hallway fight these are all moments that i think would have blown me away if i hadn't become desensitized to them after seeing them for the better part of a year something that i do feel was missing is a focus on character it's not a performance thing john david washington was great in it everyone's great in it i especially loved robert pattinson because he's just endlessly charming and single-handedly bringing about the word blimey it's not a problem with performances it's that everyone in it feels like a piece on a chessboard and sometimes that's okay i mean the team in inception kind of feel like that too but that's a story where the main character is the focus inception is what i would call a secret character study it explores the psyche of a protagonist but it bakes it into an action film inception's often criticized for being overly expositional but that's only on a surface level yeah it's teaching you about the rules of dreams but really it's teaching you about dom cobb it's a therapy movie it's a story about someone processing their trauma and i will admit that i was expecting tenet to have a similar approach i thought it would be a character-based thing in a high concept world but it's nothing like that which is fine is that a problem no it's time traveling james bond even then like the bonds we like are when bond goes a bit deeper than that and nolan usually does go a bit deeper than that and there are scenes in this film that i can tell that it wants me to care but it hasn't done the leg work to make it emotional ironically it doesn't spend enough time on it and that becomes extra frustrating when the film uses that time on moments that i think are less important i mean what's that sailing scene about what's why does that need to be there some of the timeline stuff is really fun to think about afterwards it lets you fill in some of the gaps yourself but there is part of me that craves seeing it tied up in a satisfying neat little bow there's also an implication of a wider universe here and i'm not saying that it's setting up a sequel but if it was i wouldn't be disappointed because i liked it but i'd also like to see nolan give it another go,MovieDetails,1609261308,Bd2travel,True,1,3,2020-12-29

Some questions about Come and See (1985)," 

I have some questions about this movie.

1. Why did so many Russian characters(for instance, when the boy is recruited at first a man on the cart says ""I don't understand"" in german"" speak german? Is there a historical backing to this?
2. Why did they carry a figure of Hitler when they went looking for food?
3. When the church was burnt, the German officer lets the kids come out. Firstly, why were children spared, and secondly, I don't recall seeing any more than 2 kids come out of the church? (For instance, where are the kids shown in the house Florya was hiding in?)A kid was even pushed back into the barn by a German soldier, so their distinction of who is to remain in the barn seems unclear.
4. In the end, the boy shoots a portrait of Hitler but stops just when a baby Hitler photo is shown. Why?
5. Was the boy really to blame for his village being murdered due to him digging out a gun, as the old man said?

[TOMT] Movie from around 2010 about two dinosaur brothers that got seperated as younglings and they show them each growing up and meeting later.,"Excluded movies: Land before time, walking with dinosaurs, dinosaur 2000, dino king

It was 100% a documentary but it had a story. Dinosaurs of course didn't talk as much as it seems that way it was certainly with a narrotor and it was all cgi I think

*_please read_*

plus the story began with predators attacking so everyone including the babies had to run for it. The two brothers escaped but got seperated and so they each grew up living their own lives. One of them mated later and at some point when they were grown up they met again but the single brother wanted his lady so they fought and somebody won I don't remember the details more than this.

I saw this movie about when I was 10yo I think?? Maybe 8 or 12 something too so it was definitely around 2010.

"""eXistenZ"" (1999): Why David Cronenberg's film is titled ""eXistenZ,"" rather than ""Existenz.""","Over at r/movies, I just got insulted for insisting on the correct ""appearance"" of this film's title.  I felt the need to reply; and this is a repost of what I said, which I think fits the spirit of this Site:

Why is the proper spelling of this movie's title important?

The reason Cronenberg insisted on this strange use of capital letters, is so that people wouldn't read ""Existenz"" and think it was some crappy/hip Gen-X spelling of ""existence.""

Not only is **eXistenZ** the name of the central VR-game that's explored in the film, *it's not pronounced* **ex-IS-tenz**...*it's pronounced* **EX-is-tenz.**  

Now, if you've seen the movie, you'll recall that its major theme is the surpassing and nullification of Reality by the rapidly advancing Virtual World.  (Its final line has a character, in the midst of a possibly horrible and real slaughter, yelling: ""Are we still in the game?!"")

So Cronenberg's suggestion was this:  In the same way that when one refers to a person as their ""EX-wife,"" they are saying that that person is no longer their wife, the director was (subliminally) suggesting that existing in a real-seeming video game world is an ""EX-ing"" of actual existence.

Details, it turns out, actually have crucial meanings in Art.

The Crazies (2010) - Was Russell ever sick?,"I love this movie first off, seen it tons. But always kind of think this when I rewatch it again. 

In the movie The Crazies it seems as though every time someone catches the virus, they almost quickly become pretty out of it, unable to hold a convo, or just start killing pretty quickly.

I noticed Russell is still pretty coherent by the time he sacrifices himself. This has to be at least 5 or 6 hours since he showed the first sign of ‚Äòhaving the virus‚Äô that the main characters notice, shooting those two crazy‚Äôs bodies multiple times in the house. The sacrifice scene is late at night, and he has already gone from acting nuts to being cool again, also something the crazy‚Äôs never do. Once it‚Äôs on it‚Äôs on it seems lol

I think he was legit just emotionally disturbed from his town getting destroyed, his mind snapped a little, and was just super fucking angry. Understandable really in his situation lol. Everything he does can rly just be chalked up to this. The other crazy‚Äôs never really just snap out of it and chill again like he did, and then he went at least an hour or two more of acting normal. Argument can be he is strong willed, but thats kinda just plot armour and makes no sense. 

I still like the idea he sacrifices himself so they can get away, and even if he isn‚Äôt sick, maybe be realizes he is just a threat to them if he has another episode.

I am going crazy over here. When I was in primary school, around the age of 6/7/8 we watched a biblical movie in class. It remember one piece that always stuck with me, I found it so thrilling. It was a scene where slaves in Egypt (I think) were building pyramids or buildings with large wood. When they almost finished one building it was time to move the hole thing together. But there was a woman between the two building whos dress got stuck underneath something during building. Meanwhile they continued getting the two buildings closer together with force, and the woman couldnt get out. It was so scary, and she almost got crushed. I think there was someone last minute who cut her loose and she got out just in time. I am dying to look up this scene again bc i remember so clearly.

The elevator provided him cover from the arrows and when the guards severed the chain, Tai Lung used it to swing up to them.

Gremlins (1984) - Did Something go wrong in Post-Production?,"Nowadays with 1080p to 4k viewing experience it is way easier to spot some abnormal anomalies on a television or movie screen and with this I mean to say that Gremlins has some of these within the film. Maybe I‚Äôm being a bit observant with this but here are the things I noticed like for instance:

A puppeteer can be seen below the puppet.

A head can be seen in one of the shots.

A puppet rod can be noticed on a high-quality screen.

Puppet error. (Puppet feature removed)

Those are one of the few problems that are present in the movie, now, I love the film and it‚Äôs staying power in pop culture and It deserves the love, I‚Äôm saying that there could have been a problem with ratio and cropping during the development of the film, does anyone know why they didn‚Äôt attempt to erase those problem?

If I was going to remaster Gremlins I‚Äôd do myself to find those errors and erase them digitally, I mean plenty of movies have had mistakes fixed during their remastering and It definitely could be accomplished.

Ways it could be fixed:

Digitally remove anomaly.

Fix ratio and crop out any possible noticeable anomalies.

Fix the scene lighting to overshadow anomaly.

The driver starts to antagonize Tanner. his response, ""Boy, you'd think there were ten of me."" The driver pulls a pistol out and taps it on the car door at 1:17.

Singin' in the Rain (1952) has many subtle jokes which can easily go unnoticed,"The 1952 classic Singin' in the Rain stands out not only for it's¬†comical take on an industry forced to change with the times, but also for it's subtle ways of poking fun¬†at itself in so doing.


My favorite example is in the microphone scene. Lina Lamont's shrill voice gives the director enough trouble, but when her exaggerated head swings cause the audio to miss her lines, the tech in the booth says ""She's got to talk into the mic. I can't pick it up!""


The rest of the scene is funny enough, but this one unnamed tech caused me to burst out laughing when he delivered this line. Why? Because¬†even¬†though¬†he¬†is¬†mostly¬†facing¬†away¬†from the camera,¬†a¬†keen¬†eye¬†can¬†see he isn't actually moving his mouth, and is making the same exaggerated head swings as the actress he is complaining about. They dubbed the line.


I wonder if this is a direct jab at the technology available to the studio at the time Singin'¬†in the Rain was shot. I'm no film expert, but I'd love to know if this was the case. Either way it's a clever¬†bit that I don't think many have picked up on before.

The perfect storytelling - 12 Years a slave (2013),"I have never published anything here, even on Reddit in general but I recently started youtube where I talk about analyzing films 'cause it pleases me to publish something I produce anywhere on the internet and also helps me to learn a different language, so please don't go that hard on me!

I am doing this post (is that right, ""post""?) to talk to you about something I found in a lot of drama and horror films but left aloof in the majority of photography reviews, what a dramatic waste. What I'm talking about is a technique called: long take. How many times have you heard that? In my case, before the other day, never (and it probably is my fault!).

To help me explain to you better what I'm talking about I will take as an example ""12 Years a Slave"".

There are two different scenes in this film in which give you the perfect model of two different principles of this technique.

The first one is \[SPOILER ALERT\] when Solomon was left hanging from a rope for the whole day.

Skipping the moral chunk of the film, have this continuous shot for over 90 seconds that makes us rub our noses. Maintaining the camera in that position, makes the audience feel what it's like to hang from a tree for a whole day. Although the shot seems excruciatingly long they are not really. We are uncomfortable only because the camera does not look away. We are completely on the filmmaker's hand, making use of the first principle (that I mentioned before) that makes him control and increase your emotions just by putting you under pressure.

The second one is \[SPOILER ALERT\] when Solomon is forced to whip Patsy.

This scene lasts for over three and a half minutes. The cruelty is brought to the surface by the way it is shot. It's one continuous shot and we learned from that that if you do not put a cut in an action sequence, especially a scene of extreme violence, then the audience is not subconsciously reminded that they are watching a film. Here comes the second principle, the filmmaker can let you participate in the scene making you one of the characters that are attending (differing by the first one by not only increasing the discomfort). What great usage!

As you can notice, by using the same technique in two different methods with the corresponding principles, the filmmaker can get two different effects depending on what he needs.

Please, be aware to not confuse this technique with the action sequence effect that is NOT!

I apologize for making this simple post that short, but I hope you can appreciate that!

Let me know if you have some experiences with this technique, you reviewers, and even you filmmakers if you have ever used it!

Even let me know if you have some advice on how I can Improve my English and terms to use to make more ""professional"" my thoughts here!",MovieDetails,1603669779,rawCreep,True,1,6,2020-10-25

Theory first, then question that led to theory

Theory: Tilda Swinton and the filmmakers fully actualized Helena Markos' evil; they designed her with the outline that she has never given anything in her life, she only takes. And a natural character trait evolved from there, where she never even gives back the air she breathes in, she keeps it for herself; not allowing her existence to benefit the natural world around her. Which means that her disjointed and shrill voice is because she is always breathing IN when speaking.

"In Ocean's Twelve(2004), Le Marq ran the longest con of all.","Le Marq's story is peppered through out the movie in little pieces by Rusty and Isabel.

&amp;#x200B;

Le Marq went by many aliases through out the years. When Isabel was nine, he stole the Faberge Egg as a present for his daughter's birthday. His wife was furious, told him to return the egg, and wanted him out of his daughter's life. She then told him to never come back or she would turn him in and provide enough evidence to put him away for good.

&amp;#x200B;

So what was the real plot of the movie?

&amp;#x200B;

It was about a father figuring out how to salvage his relationship with his daughter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Isabel's mom was sick and deathly ill at the time when Le Marq had his conversation on the boat with the American who suggested Benedict to Ocean. This wasn't about who was a better thief. The conversation was to get Rusty back in to his daughter's life. Le Marq could never contact his daughter while her mom was alive but upon her death he could now enter his daughter's life again. Rusty was his way in.

&amp;#x200B;

However, this would be problematic since Isabel hated thieves and had devoted herself to capturing people like her father who ,unbeknownst to her, was Le Marq. Rusty was the sympathetic connection that would allow her to see some thieves as something more than people to arrest. Le Marq had no interest in who was a better thief. He wanted his daughter back in his life and made up the drama to get the only person in his circle to get close to his daughter and allow them to talk under the right conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

In the end, Le Marq initiated the contest. Won the contest by figuring out the egg delivery. Reconciled with his daughter two weeks after her mother's death. And got her the birthday present that he was made to return so long ago.

In the end it was a Lookie Lou(Everyone running about) with a budle of joy(His daughter and her egg).

This serves as symbolism that his dad DOES see Miles' internal uniqueness and power.","In a movie that is known for having a million subtle details in it, I highly doubt the wording in this phrase is unintentional. Throughout the movie dad is often shown having trouble connecting with Miles... But in this moment, when dad lets down his guard and is talking to Miles as father and son, it shows that symbolically dad sees the hidden power in Miles, as represented by electricity.

I don't think his father literally sees Miles electrical power... But I think the word choice ""This spark in you"" shows that in that moment, dad truly and 100% understood Miles in more ways than anybody else.",MovieDetails,1603246292,Spam4119,True,1,2,2020-10-20

Heil Hubie Halloween (2020),"Is it just me or is Hubie Halloween a story about a middle aged incel who triumphs over black and brown brown folks and a stereotypical ""hot-blooded"" I-talian; most of whom are depicted as sexual deviants. He then ""graciously"" stops them from being barbarically executed. The Barrabas/Christ metaphor was pretty strong there. The film ends with his crowning achievement being to dethrone a corrupt black mayor; returning political rule to the whites as supported by the chief of police. He also grew up in scouts, a paramilitary organization, where he acquired his ""arsenal"" depicted as his thermos. At one point Hubie was appointed by the chief of police as a ""secret one man militia"".

It seems like this film is a perfect formula even down to the way where one of the bad guys is dressed as a LGBT icon and the Catholic priest was hung upside down in the style of Peter.

I know this movie is old, but it‚Äôs a holds a special place in my life so I watched it again on Netflix this week.

How the hell does Sir Ector have enough time to take a break hundreds of yards away from the jousting ring between lance 2-3? For the rest of the movie, they may get a couple minutes between ‚Äúrounds‚Äù but hell, this dude took a damn lunch break. 

How long was he gone? He‚Äôs been gone so long that his squires go searching for him and are stunned that he‚Äôs dead and claim he smells so bad they have to place stuff in their nose. The scene is reminiscent of a person dead for days.

The Polar Express (2004) bugs me a lot,"I know a lot of people love this movie, but it really really bugs me when I see it. Specifically the train on ice scene. Here‚Äôs my rant. 

Trains have solid axles. Wheels can‚Äôt spin separately. So when he‚Äôs shifting from forward to reverse trying to angle it towards the mountains? Can‚Äôt happen

Steam trains don‚Äôt shift from forward to reverse and back quickly. Especially not that quickly.

The locomotive alone probably weighs around 200 tons, and that whole weight is pressing down on very small areas on the ice. Where the wheels touch ice. Ice cracks very easily when even small amounts of weight is applied to a very focused area, that‚Äôs why you can lie down on ice and not go through, but stand on your feet and you crash right through

The fact that all of the knuckle couplers holding while a train jack knives while reversing is laughable

Also the fact that they straightened out enough to hit the rails on the other side of the lake

And the worst part? There is absolutely no grip whatsoever on between ice and metal wheels. That‚Äôs why the bottoms of ice skates are metal. You slide because theres no friction aka traction. The train would never be able to get going in a million years, it‚Äôd just sit there spinning it‚Äôs wheels until it eventually falls through the ice

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I like the movie, but this scene just felt stupid and unnecessary. Imagine cutting this entire scene out. Nothing lost.

The 18th Variation from Sergei Rachmaninoff‚Äôs ‚ÄúRhapsody on a Theme by Paganini‚Äù - and how the song answers two key questions in two of the best Non-Science Fiction Time Travel/Love Story movies ever: Groundhog Day (1993) and Somewhere In Time (1980),"In the beginning of ‚ÄúSomewhere In Time‚Äù, an elderly Elise McKenna finds a young, naive Richard Collier, hands him a pocket watch and says ""Come back to me!"" - a wonderful and memorable cinematic moment. But HOW did she find him 68 years in the future?

Phil Conners spends who knows how long re-living the same day over and over in ‚ÄúGroundhog Day,‚Äù a classic masterpiece of cinema as well. But exactly HOW does he finally escape into the next day?

The answer to both is in the same piece of classical music written in 1932. 

(Spoilers) 

How the heck does Elise re-find Richard - when there are decades separating them and he NEVER once uttered a single word about being a time traveler. HOW did she figure out that the man she's recently fallen in love with is really from 68 years in the future? Because without the pocket watch hand-off scene, Richard would not, in turn, recognize Elise in an old photo album and he would not have had the mental strength to make the trip through time... and ... the movie is ruined. 

My first thought was the 1979 penny. If only Richard had simply dropped it back in 1912 it would have all made sense. But he didn‚Äôt. In fact, screenwriter Richard Matheson (and director Jeannot Szwarc) makes a huge point to have Richard dropping it on the floor once he's returned back to 1980. So... no.

It took me a long time to find the movie‚Äôs subtle explanation: the 18th Variation from Sergei Rachmaninoff‚Äôs ‚ÄúRhapsody on a Theme by Paganini‚Äù - which is Richard‚Äôs favorite song in the movie. It‚Äôs also used in another favorite time travel movie, Harold Ramis‚Äô ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù - the song Phil Connors slowly learns to play on the piano.

The reason it is called ‚ÄúRachmaninoff‚Äôs 18th Variation‚Äù is because he created 24 variations of another piece of music originally composed by Niccolo Paganini; this is the 18th one. Listen to the first few minutes of this video you'll see why Rachmaninoff (and others) wanted to work with it and alter it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33q87s03h4[Rachmaninov: Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c33q87s03h4) In short, Paganini‚Äôs piece was so simple and perfect, that it begged to be varied, mixed up, riffed and added to.

A song with many variations makes it the perfect choice for a movie like Groundhog Day. Rachmaninoff's piece begins pretty much the same as Paganini‚Äôs piece, Phil‚Äôs journey starts just like the other annual trips. But the first variation adds in a few more notes here and there - and it becomes much more playful and lighthearted. Much like Phil‚Äôs first reactions to living the same day over is demonstrated in quirky conversations with the Inn Keeper and Ned. The second variation is then marked by daring flourishes from the piano‚Ä¶ Phil tries out a few things; steals some money and sucker punches Ned. As more variations happen the piece grows darker‚Ä¶ Phil becomes depressed because he realizes he cannot really change anything that matters... i.e the old man dying. He realizes he is stuck. 

Then, the 7th variation introduces a second theme: The ‚ÄúDies Irae‚Äù from the Roman Catholic Requiem Mass (Mass for the Dead or Funeral Mass) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dies_Irae. This translates in the film as Phil trying to escape his situation by attempting to commit suicide. It is this added death element that gives weight to the music as well as the movie.

But the best parallel though is the famous 18th Variation‚Ä¶ again, obviously paralleled because it‚Äôs the actual part that Phil learns to play on the piano, but it also explains what Phil needs to do to move on. In this variation Rachmaninoff literally flips the page of Paganini‚Äôs music upside down - where before the notes went up, they now go down and vice versa. Transpose it into a major key and slow it down and you end up with the famous 18th variation‚Ä¶ and one of the most recognized and beautiful love songs ever. In the movie, Phil sees things from another point of view. He takes the negative elements of Punxsutawney, (kid falling from tree, flat tire, choking, etc.) flips them and makes them positives. Phil escapes from his predicament into something different and good‚Ä¶ because ""anything different is good.‚Äù For good measure, Phil even takes Rachmaninoff‚Äôs 18 Variation and makes a jazzy variation of his own.

So, then, HOW did Elise know WHEN to find Richard. In a very, VERY short throw-away scene, Richard and Elise are in a row boat in 1912 and he starts humming his favorite song. She comments how lovely it is and asks, ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù ‚ÄúRachmaninoff, Rhapsody‚Äù he replies. She says she loves Rachmaninoff, but she has never heard that piece. He smiles and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll introduce it to you sometime.‚Äù - And that‚Äôs it. End of scene. That's all there is to the movie's very subtle explanation for how Elise found Richard later on. You see, Rachmaninoff did not compose Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini until 1934. So, when Elise eventually heard it, recognized it, and realized there was only one way Richard could have known about the same song 22 years earlier, she knew where she could find him‚Ä¶ somewhere in time. 

She just needed to sit still and wait for a playwright named Richard Collier to come along. Which is exactly what people said Elise did for 68 years. 

To put a finer point on it, it‚Äôs as if screenwriter Richard Matheson is really a modern Niccolo Paganini - creating the perfect Non-Science Fiction Time Travel/Love Story‚Ä¶ and screenwriter/director Harold Ramis is the modern Sergei Rachmaninoff - creating different variation of that theme.

The Wolf of Snow Hollow (2020) Red Herring Question *SPOILERS*,"I have a question I've not yet seen addressed if someone thinks they can weigh in and assist.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;!There was an initial suspect that OD'd and had a wolf tattoo and lived in trailer with a wolfy lookin dog. He is shown at one point burning a naked body in a pile of sticks and wood. Then later we see him OD and then the story establishes that they THINK he was the killer who matched the description of the Werewolf (tall male with a wolf tattoo) and since he's dead case closed right? ""You still win when the other guy sinks the eight ball"" So when were shown that he could have been the killer but OD'd before we could confirm it - but then the Hunt for the Killer continues we kind of forget about the burning body because the story establishes well the OD guy can't be the killer. Right?!&lt;

&gt;!I had a thought that perhaps the guy that OD actually WAS the Werewolf and was responsible for some of the killings - With the Killer in the suit also committing some killings - or maybe even just the lady at the beginning with the seam ripper left as evidence.!&lt;

&gt;!Jim Cummings said he read up a lot on serial killers for this movie and used that inspiration for the twist. A lot of Serial Killers take credit for kills that they did not perpetrate. Another commonality is that Copycat killers sometimes occur.!&lt;

&gt;!Perhaps the Costume Killer was simply inspired or saw opportunity to pin his crimes elsewhere. He seemed amused when John was lamenting to him that the crimes have been pinned on the junkie.!&lt;

&gt;!I'm not sure what to think about the burning body from the OD ""Killer"" I'm not sure if I missed something in the movie dialog or story that might point to a confirm or deny for my theory I was curious what everyone else thought? Am I on to something here?!&lt;

&gt;!I enjoyed the movie a great deal btw. I thought the limited exposure to visuals of the Werewolf was a nice and underutilized touch. I thought it was a very well done Werewolf movie and yes I DO consider it a Werewolf movie especially in light of my theory that there always was a Werewolf amongst them up until the dude OD'd!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

Movie : The Legend of Bhagat Singh (2002),"There's a scene of a jail where Bhagat Singh and his comrades watch one of their own crying desperately to drink water for he had consumed a fist full of red chilli powder but all they get is a pitcher full of milk. They refuse to drink it. 

The scene follows with a beautiful rendition of the famous poem/anthem and war-cry of the Indian Independence Movement of that era , "" Sarfaroshi ki Tammanna"" [Translation : Wish of Sacrifice ] written by Ram Prasad Bismil ( Pen Name : Bismil Aziimabadi). Their thirst seems to slowly fade away as the song progresses. 

That rendition is based on Raag ""Desh Malahar"" ( a melodic framework of Hindustani Classical Music  ) which  communicates fundamental expressions of country(Desh) and rain(Malahar), something that made them forget that they needed water at all. 

Bhagat Singh's Hunger Strike lasted for 116 days.

Good Will Hunting (1997)-- Sean's backstory,"In Sean's office, there is a diploma from MIT...and that made me think about Sean's backstory.  So, I started thinking about Sean's backstory, and details:

1. Sean has a degree from MIT, but not in psychology.  MIT is one of the world's leading STEM universities, but not in psychology.   It does not have classes about clinical psychology (i.e., counseling).  
2. Sean did counseling in the 1970s and early 1980s.  He was a teacher at a junior college--meaning he had to at least have a Master Degree in psychology.  He must have went to a different school for his degree.
3. He and Lambeau were roommates at MIT.  Lambeau said Sean was ""smarter than he was back then.""
4. Sean fought in Vietnam.
5. Some of his MIT classmates consider him a failure.
6. He made a conscious choice about his career path.

This is what I believe happened:

Sean originally was at MIT majoring in mathematics, engineering, physics, or something., where he roomed with Lambeau.  He got his degree in a STEM major (or ""course of study"") from MIT.   Sean was a top student at MIT, and people thought he was destined for greatness in the sciences.

After graduation from college, Sean was either drafted or volunteered for the military.  He may have volunteered because his best friend volunteered for the service. 

Sean went to Vietnam.   His experiences on the battlefield, and specifically the death of his best friend, changed him.  After the war, he was no longer interested in STEM.  

He got an an advanced degree (but not a PhD) in clinical psychology from some other, lesser school.  After the death of his wife, he didn't want to do counseling, so he got a job teaching at a junior college in Boston.",MovieDetails,1602021059,MisterMysterion,True,1,3,2020-10-06

{The} Hours 2002 - Scene Analysis,"Alright, I've wanted to do this post since forever so I'll jump straight into it.

The following scene is from movie The Hours and has Nicole Kidman (Virgina Woolf) and Miranda Richardson (Nessa Bell) as sisters saying goodbye to each other after Nessa's visit. 

There's so much going on here in such a short time, yet somehow what has to be delivered is delivered perfectly. I can't get over this scene, it's almost perfect. The set design, the costumes, the pacing, the acting my God the acting and especially the soundtrack. The way Nicole Kidman inhibited Virgina Woolf, how truly lost she manages to be and seem just simply from her eyes is mind-blowing, honestly. The way she says Nessa at the end, those two teardrops simply at the perfect time, her performance in this is frankly something else. Not enough people talk about her in this. Whereas the depth and intensity the soundtrack manages to add is almost unreal and even scary. Phillip Glass is a genius.

However 3 questions I've always had related to this scene are : Why does she kiss Nessa? When she says ""You think, one day I might escape"" does she mean to escape from her own condition? Lastly, how do you interpret when she says Nessa as she leaves? I've always wondered what she wants to say with that.

Both those of you who are familiar with this movie and are not, I'd be more than curious to find out your opinion. On this movie overall, the story, acting, the soundtrack and of course this scene! What's your take on it and the questions above? Looking forward to hear everyone's point of view!

Dr Strange 2016 - Strange doesn't sound very Doctory," 

So when Dr Strange is talking to the Ancient One he says ""How did you correct a complete C7, C8 spinal cord injury?""

The premise is the patient couldn't walk and was paralyzed, yet the c7 - c8 are the last two discs before the thoracic and then the lumbar. Not really uncommon knowledge. It's probably possible but I would think they'd refer to the lumbar or Thoracic rather than the neck (I actually had disc fusion surgery last year on c6 - c7).

He also refers to it as a c7 c8 spinal cord injury which could refer to a place in the spine but likely not as they are discs. He makes it a point to make sure everyone knows he's smarter than everyone else (According to him) yet this description sounds elementary in Doctor speak.

The Lighthouse (2019) Setting Theory,"Looked a bit online and haven‚Äôt seen this discussed. I think the movie the Lighthouse takes place in Hell. 

The movie makes rampant references to classical mythology. Most of it is maybe to Neptune‚Äôs various forms and accoutrements, but the references are throughout. There‚Äôs also such a dramatic style that calls to stage tragedies originating from those classical eras in Greece and Rome. The story itself is structured very similar to a classical tragedy as well, with the clueless doomed masochistic protagonist, where it‚Äôs basically just missing the characteristic chorus that could be argued are the seagulls. 

Howard‚Äôs end of the film death scene where he‚Äôs being torn at by seagulls is overt reference to the Prometheus myth. In the Greek underworld, punishments were often infinitely recurring. Rocks rolling down hills. River drying for the thirsty man every time he stoops to drink. When Prometheus is chained to the rock, he is to be torn at by the eagle forever. It is Howard‚Äôs fate to be torn at by birds over and over. 

When Howard is lowered on the ropes and painting the Lighthouse around early to mid movie, he‚Äôs dropped in a dramatic sequence where he takes a bad fall. Then he‚Äôs basically and suddenly fine. If you rewatch the sequence it‚Äôs edited almost like it‚Äôs missing a chunk of film. The movie then plays out. He eventually falls down the stairs after stealing access to Zeus‚Äô fire, and he is torn at by seagulls as the credits come. 

I think this is his second death in the movie. He lied there when he fell painting as well, and seagulls ate him then as well. It just didn‚Äôt show it and cut to his post-respawn. It‚Äôs an inevitable Hell loop from Greek mythology. Even at the beginning of the movie they‚Äôre arriving in a ship, crossing over water like the boatman myth in Hades. Howard could‚Äôve drowned in the logs before arriving. He could‚Äôve killed him self for guilt. Either way he‚Äôs already dead and in classical perdition. And think of how he arrives. He is only there for money. He‚Äôs miserable. He‚Äôs only ‚Äòseeing‚Äô money as the sole benefit of being there. The dead were sent to the underworld in Ancient Greece with coins in their eyes. 

Wake is a tormenter. A demon assigned to make Howard‚Äôs existence miserable and drive him to panic and delusion. Or it‚Äôs just his guilt and fears manifest. Nonetheless, this is Howard‚Äôs Hell; and Wake operates throughout bordering on being an illusion similar to Tyler Durden, always having Howard do big physical things that happen in the movie.",MovieDetails,1600840565,starship350,True,1,4,2020-09-22

Thor reluctantly agrees but when he starts to walk away a frost giant calls him a ""little princess"".  This enrages Thor and he attacks the frost giants starting a war between Jotunheim and Asgard.  The little known fact about this scene is that the Frost giant didn't actually say this: it was Loki using his magic to deceive Thor.  Loki needed Thor to break the truce to start a war so he could manipulate events to his benefit.  This was Loki's first deception and a very subtle one that hints at Loki's manipulative nature.

Idk how old the girl is, but there‚Äôs a sleeping girl in a trailer I believe with her mom or someone. She‚Äôs woken up by a noise and looks out her window (ground floor) to see her friend. She waves and he/she (I think he) waves back and motions for her to open the window. She opens the window and they talk for a second and they try to get her to go with them and she doesn‚Äôt want to. They grab her arm trying to force her out and she starts freaking/screaming the person sleeping next to her wakes up and calls out for help and a male comes in slams the window shut (it opens sideways) and this things hand/arm gets cut off or it‚Äôs still attached, but they see it‚Äôs not her friend. I think towards the end of that the cops got called and someone‚Äôs watching or it‚Äôs the camera view from the forest line. I forgot to mention this trailer is basically in the middle of nowhere in the forest, but close enough to whatever town it‚Äôs near.

TRYING TO THINK OF THIS MOVIE I WATCHED IN 1990s-EARLY 2000s. MY TWEAKS WONT STOP TIL I REMEMBER THIS MOVIE. PLEASE HELP.,"So I'm sitting here (for hours now). Worked a full 12hr shift. In my scrubs still. Trying to remember this movie I'm pretty sure existed that iwatched way way back. It's like 1990s-early 2000s. It was this (African American) guy who gets turned into this fleshy/melting looking monster and he's trying to figure out how to get back normal to see his family. I think he does some heroic deeds and wore a hoodie. (It‚Äôs not ‚Äúbeastly‚Äù) Like I remember a scene where he watches his daughter from a tree outside her window talking to someone else on what he should do. Idk if he was able to turn back normal or anything else. It wasn't meant to be a scary movie. I think it was kind of like Little Nicky but not as funny. 

You know what I'm talking about? Maybe let it simmer in your head for a while. I'm pretty sure I didn't dream this movie. I can't find anything online because my description sucks. But that‚Äôs all I got. Please. I need to know the name of this movie.",MovieDetails,1600219861,Only-Ad-2063,True,1,26,2020-09-15
