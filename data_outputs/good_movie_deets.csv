"Inglorious Basterds (2009) Hans Landa is wearing a medal that shows he participated in the beer hall putsch in the 20s, and has been a party member since then, long before most people even knew what a Nazi was. This suggests his pretenses not to be ideological and merely an opportunist are a ploy.","To be clear, I think he is also an opportunist. But he oversells that aspect of himself once it becomes clear the Nazis have lost the war.

He isn't just a Nazi. He's one of the first Nazis.

IMO this is a great movie detail because most people completely buy the way he presents himself and think he's merely pretending to be ideological and fooling the nazis. That he's ""Just an amoral detective"" and the nazis employ him to detect Jews. The presence of this medal indicates that he is fooling those people into thinking he's fooling the nazis, but unless you know how to recognize a Nazi and know what to look for, his disguise works. People assume he's an ""Opportunist"" because he convincingly sells himself as one.

Some questions about Come and See (1985)," 

I have some questions about this movie.

1. Why did so many Russian characters(for instance, when the boy is recruited at first a man on the cart says ""I don't understand"" in german"" speak german? Is there a historical backing to this?
2. Why did they carry a figure of Hitler when they went looking for food?
3. When the church was burnt, the German officer lets the kids come out. Firstly, why were children spared, and secondly, I don't recall seeing any more than 2 kids come out of the church? (For instance, where are the kids shown in the house Florya was hiding in?)A kid was even pushed back into the barn by a German soldier, so their distinction of who is to remain in the barn seems unclear.
4. In the end, the boy shoots a portrait of Hitler but stops just when a baby Hitler photo is shown. Why?
5. Was the boy really to blame for his village being murdered due to him digging out a gun, as the old man said?

{The} Hours 2002 - Scene Analysis,"Alright, I've wanted to do this post since forever so I'll jump straight into it.

The following scene is from movie The Hours and has Nicole Kidman (Virgina Woolf) and Miranda Richardson (Nessa Bell) as sisters saying goodbye to each other after Nessa's visit. 

There's so much going on here in such a short time, yet somehow what has to be delivered is delivered perfectly. I can't get over this scene, it's almost perfect. The set design, the costumes, the pacing, the acting my God the acting and especially the soundtrack. The way Nicole Kidman inhibited Virgina Woolf, how truly lost she manages to be and seem just simply from her eyes is mind-blowing, honestly. The way she says Nessa at the end, those two teardrops simply at the perfect time, her performance in this is frankly something else. Not enough people talk about her in this. Whereas the depth and intensity the soundtrack manages to add is almost unreal and even scary. Phillip Glass is a genius.

However 3 questions I've always had related to this scene are : Why does she kiss Nessa? When she says ""You think, one day I might escape"" does she mean to escape from her own condition? Lastly, how do you interpret when she says Nessa as she leaves? I've always wondered what she wants to say with that.

Both those of you who are familiar with this movie and are not, I'd be more than curious to find out your opinion. On this movie overall, the story, acting, the soundtrack and of course this scene! What's your take on it and the questions above? Looking forward to hear everyone's point of view!

Donnie Darko [2001],"I think this is just a mistake in filming because you can see the director cut board in the reflection in the window of the car while the scene is being recorded. But it says Darko right before they almost run into Grandma Death (Roberta Sparrow). Donnie has to yell at his dad to turn his head. Darko is visible behind his head in the reflection.

The Riot Club (2014) line,"hello,

i have recently rewatched ***The Riot Club*** for at least 10 or 15 times. despite its mostly negative reviews i found online, i really enjoy it. 

however i have not managed to understand a ***latin phrase*** from the movie, more specifically, the scene when they are around the table with their glasses up, at the famous club diner. the script of the sequence is:

""It's our time, gentlemen.

Let us eat till we explode,

drink till our eyes fall out,

let us dance footloose upon the Earth,

and carpe some fucking diem!

We who are about to dine, salute you.""

\*inaudible phrase in latin\*

""Imbibe.""

by searching google i have found something about the Latin phrase ""Ave, Imperator, **morituri te salutant**"" (""Hail, Emperor, those who are about to die salute you""). i'm sure it has something to do with this, but it's slightly different.

nor the subtitles or the script i found, have nothing regarding this.

if there is someone who has also seen the movie or has an idea of what they could be saying in that specific part, please let me know as i am trying to figure this out for years now...for personal research purposes.",MovieDetails,1598721557,AndreiGeorge22,True,1,1,2020-08-29

The Big Ugly 2020 with Vinnie Jones,"Anglo-American relations go bad when London mob bosses invest in a West Virginia oil deal in hopes of laundering dirty money.

Neeyln (Vinnie Jones) has always been the loyal enforcer for crime boss Harris (Malcolm McDowell) back in London, taking care of problems and people that disrupt his illicit business. 

When Harris strikes a deal with an old friend — American oilman Preston (Ron Perlman) — they find themselves in the wild hills of West Virginia. Contracts are signed and the whiskey flows in celebration, but overnight Neelyn’s girlfriend disappears, last seen with Preston’s wayward son Junior. 

Lines are drawn between family and friends, but nothing will stop Neelyn from getting answers — and retribution.

Overall, [The Big Ugly](https://portalultautv.net/the-big-ugly-2020/) is one of Vinnie Jones finest hours with a well told story, surprisingly layered characters and some bloody violence.

My thoughts on the Colors in Sin City (2005),"I wouldn’t call Sin City an adaptation of the comic novel, but a comic novel comes alive.Some might not fond of its script, its novelistic cinematography, music or acting. However, they are terrific for me. Not only one but three stories were showed in the hyperlink style like Pulp Fiction. They were magnetizing enough to glue my eyes to the screen.

I want to try expressing my opinions on the few colors that appeared throughout the movie in particular situations. This is merely subjective and I’m totally open to any discussion. ( I wrote this as a way to practice my English, it is not my mother tongue)

I. The yellow bastard

The movie was mainly black and grey to embody the cruelty and ruthlessness of Sin City.

The first color presented was white at its purest, the color of perfection. It also means innocence and completion. We only see this color when blood was shed, the blood of our protagonist who just fulfilled his noble mission. White here meant the end. The screen shaded black and white when Hartigan committed that righteous act, this was the deliverance from the hell world of black and grey.

Blood was also … blood. A thick dark red color of blood. I could nearly see Hartigan in color, when his black and grey image was covered in red. This was suffering, miserable and anger. Soaked in blood but our main didn’t die, he refused to give up. Red was also strength since blood rain in his veins, it stimulated his body, his emotion, resulted in his actions.The dim red in the strip club symbolized sexual energy, sexual desire. It was like burning inside Harligan when he was about to meet his love again. The lustful atmosphere along with the feeling of love spread the faded red to whole scene, faintly. Also in the bar, the green light flashed a few times from the signs, like a bit of positivity among the hopeless black.

For the viewer, whenever we see a scene turns red, we got excited, we know something is happening, mentally and physically. Red now means danger as it draws our attention.

The last color is yellow, as in the name. Surprisingly, yellow is a positive color of lively energy. Bright yellow of hope and optimism. But the antagonist had a dark and dirty yellow as if his energy only used to serve the devil. Yellow sparked the red love between Harligan and the girl but also brought the deadly white to it.

Finally, yellow meant cowardice. Just look at our villain, he was a person of no importance without his father.

II. The hard goodbye

We started with red: love, drama, danger and sexual desire. Goldie looked like a goddess in that red dress with her yellow fluffy curly hair. No wonder why there was nothing occupied Marv’s mind but revenge in the name of love. This red and yellow (love, sexual desire and hope, happiness) combination gave the man a straight and clear thought of vengeance, to go and lay his anger upon anyone who was responsible. Only Goldie had colors so we all understand she was the one true love of Marv.

The dress wasn’t the only thing which was painted red. There was also blood, red from the start till end. It wasn’t changed into white and his eyes were filled with red in the last moment for the reason that he may have gone to the other world, but his love for Goldie stays.

III. The big fat kill

The first color appeared on screen was red once again. Another drama bonded to love and a lot of actions from the outburst of masculine energy.

The next color showed up was blue. Blue exhibits truth, calmness and peace. Ironically enough, the car of the antagonist was blue but the man driving it could be anything but definitely none of the meanings attached to blue. He was a defamation for everything blue represents.

The eye color of the betrayal hooker was also blue. Maybe the director had something to do with trust issue.

Later we have the combination of blue and green from the reflection of police car’s light. A mixture of urgency and calmness, precisely describes the expression of Dwight and his circumstance.Green light blinked a few times along the driveway like a glimmer of hope for our main to get out of the mess.

The movie ended with the red sky full of love.

The Dark Knight (2008): Batman choosing to go after Rachel instead of Harvey when made to choose by the Joker should have been a huge pointer to Gordon and anyone else at the police station that Bruce Wayne is Batman. (explanation in comments),"https://youtu.be/9oiaQLz_OoI

Batman choosing to save a lawyer over the DA just doesn't add up unless he is somehow related to Rachel. 

In this situation, Harvey is exponentially more important than Rachel (to everyone in Gotham other than Bruce and Harvey). The city has more to lose if Harvey dies. So why would a vigilante who fights for the people make such a boneheaded choice unless he has a personal connection with Rachel?

This should have been a huge pointer as to who Batman could be or at least narrow down the field to lovers/family members of Rachel. Rachel could have had partners who were not Harvey Dent or Bruce Wayne but still the list won't be that long or hard to investigate.

P.S.: It could be that Gordon just didn't want to know or find out who Batman actually was but this is too big a point for others in the station to dismiss. 

Also, it could be that everyone was under so much stress at that moment, that they completely dismissed it. But again, since the Batman is choosing to go after Rachel than the DA should at least raise some eyebrows.",MovieDetails,1577949572,epixyll,True,1,14,2020-01-01

In the real world, Switch would be male, and in the Matrix, Switch would be female - a very clever and critical point of the 'residual self-image' idea. When the actress, Belinda McClory auditioned for the role, she was going for only half the role - Switch's Matrix form.

Warner Brothers made the decision to cut this and give Switch one form for both environments. Understandably, the Wachowski sisters chose to make Switch female.

Switch's presentation is deliberately androgynous to pay homage to her original concept.""

The big question throughout the movie was how it would end with the Manson family, and the payoff was spectacular (I laughed my ass off). A lot of people have pointed out the connection to Inglorious Basterds ending and this through Rick’s role in the WW2 movie. However, we actually get a more direct connection with the alternative history endings in the phrase “Once Upon a Time”. Inglorious Basterds also opens with this phrase and we know how that ends.

An amazing detail I found on one of the concert scenes.,"I just realized this detail that from what I've seen from many of the Perfect Blue videos that no one has mentioned yet from what I know.

Photo of the detail I am analyzing: https://photos.app.goo.gl/6ibFaeK8PQYxofES7

In ""Perfect Blue"", I found this really fascinating detail which is very cleverly done. First, I'll mention the context of this scene. Mima has now show off her body in order to progress in her career and ""become more of a woman"". Also, keep on working as an actress to take in more mature roles. The alter ego, Pop idol Mima is meant to represent the side of Mima who wants to ""stay as a child"" and live in her past. Not grow as a person. She doesn't want pop idol mima to leave as she is a part of her but she also needs to stay an actress but Pop Idol Mima wants to reunite and sing along with the ex Cham members and she says that the audience doesn't want her as an actress but rather, her pop idol persona.

Now, let's translate the spanish subtitles of what it says on Pop idol Mima's dialogue. First, she says: ""What everyone wants is ..."" As we can tell, pop idol mima does not finish the sentence at that moment but we later hear the lyrics of the concert with the ex cham members after that. It seems to continue what ""she was trying to say"".

On the lyrics, it says:""... read comics instead of complicated books and ... I want to remain forever the way I am"". It's as if the lyrics were finishing the sentence for her.

If we translate the meaning of the lyrics mixed with pop idol mima's dialogue with the themes of the film, this little moment already says so much. What the film is trying to say here is about how people just want to stay as children who read silly comic books rather than be adults and  read more educative and important books to help them reach a brighter future and grow up into smarter and more mature individuals. This says most of what the film means. People obsessing over things that do not really matter instead of focusing on things that can really make us improve. How we devolve to relive our past rather than advance to the future and make harder choices in life. How we want to stay in a easier life rather than move on to a much harder one. The amount of self-awareness with this film. Also, this is being hidden in a shallow pop song to be sung to a more ""immature"" audience like the otakus, which is quite ironic. Now, it is not judging all otakus but rather, it is judging those very obssesed and problematic type of otakus that refuse to grow up. Also, given the possibility that that is Rumi is pop idol Mima at that very moment, the song is not just judging Mima's alter ego and toxic otakus but also Rumi's obsession to relive her past as a pop idol in the much more attractive and successful appearance of Mima.

Hopefully, this isn't too much words for 1 detail.",MovieDetails,1559749806,Gattsu2000,True,1,1,2019-06-05

"In Spaceballs (1987), 'going plaid' may be a play on 'warp speed', and 'warp' which is a term used to decribe fabric weaving.","In the Star Wars movies, which Spaceballs is a parody of, a hyperdrive to enter 'hyperspace' and travel at 'light speed'. When this happens, the stars on the screen blur from points of light to streaks, creating a visual pattern.

In Spaceballs, when the protagonists enter [hyper speed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk7VWcuVOf0), their pursuers decide to go one step further and travel at 'ludicrous speed' to catch them up. A similar visual phenomena where the stars blur occurs, but then something else happens - the light changes again into a multi-coloured goemetric pattern. Upon observing this, our heroes remark 'They've gone into plaid!'.

Now, strictly speaking there is no 'warp speed' in Star Wars, rather it features in [Star Trek](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Warp_factor) and other narrative settings. However, it's narrative function is more or less identical: that only ships with 'warp drives' are able to travel that fast, allowing travel between star systems on a practical time scale (and granting a tactical edge in chases).

Apart from being a parody of space travel in science fiction, I couldn't help but think that 'going plaid' may be a play on ['warp'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_and_weft), which is a fairly common term in the context of weaving and fabrics (like plaid).

Specifically, [plaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartan) 'is made with alternating bands of coloured (pre-dyed) threads woven as both warp and weft at right angles to each other.'

I won't go so far as to say that I think this is a certainty, but Spaceballs is a film [jam-packed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcArnepkhv0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=86) with puns and wordplay so I don't feel it would be out of place.

The Jackal - 1997 - Bruce Willis - Character is wearing bulletproof vest when killed,"I have loved this movie for over 20 years. Now, for some reason, I am only just realizing this detail. It's so clear that the Jackal character is wearing a bulletproof vest in these scenes. He is a master of disguises, but he only covers his police disguise with a jacket, after throwing away the hat and wig.

&amp;#x200B;

Clear outline of bulletproof vest:

https://i.redd.it/ilarsuzuvvw21.png

[You can actually see the velcro in the image above that holds the vest over the shoulders](https://i.redd.it/sxn35szuvvw21.png)

[The outline is perfectly clear above](https://i.redd.it/nvpcorzuvvw21.png)

[This is him putton on his new disguise](https://i.redd.it/vxknytzuvvw21.png)

[Here, he is still wearing the same jacket over the blue police shirt, right as he is shot in the chest. It's the only visible body shot in this scene. After this shot, he's just covered in random blood splotches. ](https://i.redd.it/e46qnqzuvvw21.png)

It's a bit annoying to see this now, and I wonder why they did this. The movie made perfect sense with him getting shot in the neck. It feels as though they decided to add some extra suspense at the very last moment. Which gives me pause for thought, too, because if the Jackal character died from the neck wound, then it would have meant that Isabella got revenge for the Jackal killing her unborn baby. With Declan delivering the death blows to the chest, it seems to rob her character of that vengeance without significantly contributing to the story. Although, a single gunshot to the neck is a somewhat anticlimactic way to finish a character as notorious as the Jackal.",MovieDetails,1557276726,LunchK1d,True,1,5,2019-05-07

"In the beginning of Oceans 11 (2001) Rusty tells Danny they will need ""a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros and a Leon Spinks, not to mention the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever!"" These are references to old cons from the 20th century and Rusty just gave away how they will rob the casino.","Source: Quora
https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-names-and-meanings-of-all-the-cons-in-the-Oceans-movie-trilogy

A Boesky: Saul playing Lyman Zerga. This is a reference to Ivan Boesky, a big-time trader on Wall Street who got caught committing securities fraud. The con is about a wealthy bankroller who has insider information.

A Jim Brown: the confrontation between Frank Catton and Linus Caldwell, staged to distract Terry Benedict so that Linus can lift the security codes to the vault. Named for the famous American football player

A Miss Daisy: references the SWAT truck our con men used as their getaway car. 'driving miss daisy' is a movie about a woman who has to get a chauffeur to drive her around. under the guise of the SWAT truck, Danny, Rusty and the gang can escape without a hitch.

Two Jethros: refers to the Malloy brothers, Turk and Virgil. The two jethros are the 'hillbilly, gear-headed types"" who are hired to look after miss daisy. In the movie, they provide general two-man work like the distraction they pull with the balloons covering the security camera on the casino floor so Livingston can get into the video surveillance room.

Leon Spinks: the distraction in the form of disrupting the boxing match. there was this episode of NCIS once where the director went home to Chicago to investigate the death of his boxer friend. in the episode, they mentioned this boxing match where Leon Spinks beat Muhammad Ali, and it was a total upset that no one expected. no one expected the power to go out in the middle of the match in the movie, either, and it created absolute chaos, which was great for our con artists.

Ella Fitzgerald: the idea to loop a tape of a robbery over Benedict's security system, a robbery which had actually been staged the previous night as a distraction while the real robbery takes place. it comes from a commercial for memorex i saw in my ad production class the other week where a recording of Ella Fitzgerald's voice breaks a glass, then the voice over says, ""is it live or is it memorex?"" the concept is that Benedict doesn't know if the robbery he's seeing is the robbery that's actually happening.

Twilight: 20 Wild Revelations About Jacob And His Family,"

The central romantic triangle between Edward Cullen, Bella Swan and Jacob Black is the dynamic that defines the **_Twilight_** universe. While the Team Edward versus Team Jacob debate still lives on between fans, there is much more to explore in the series– especially when it comes to Jacob himself, considering that he does not win Bella’s affections in the end. Jacob’s family history involving the Quileute tribe is incredibly interesting, and an underreported story in the books and films. There is an incredible story involving legends and tribal tales that is interwoven in to the love triangle that deserves more attention.

While Jacob Black is normally marketed as the second choice in the _Twilight_series, there is much more to him– and his family. The concept of a tribe of shape-shifting teenage wolves is fascinating, and only becomes more interesting when all the characters are analyzed. Standing next to Jacob are other tribe members like Sam Uley, and Seth and Leah Clearwater. Each of these characters are involved in something much deeper than a love triangle. In fact, there are many Quileute legends dispersed in their characterizations that deserve a closer look.

If fans were to separate themselves from the Cullens, they would see _Twilight_is filled with many other interesting characters. Stephenie Meyer has built a rich history about the Quileute into her universe, and there are a lot of interesting facts about this family. Thankfully, this series gives fans a direct look in to how such a tribe would actually operate, and we only want to learn more.

Here are **20 Wild Revelations About Jacob And His Family.**

20 They’re Not Actually Werewolves
--------------------------------

Despite most people in the _Twilight_series referring to Jacob and his family as werewolves, that is not the right term. Lumping them alongside werewolves removes all of the tribal history that goes along with their change.

A werewolf is someone who transforms from a human into a monstrous wolf, usually on the full moon. The Quileute tribe, on the other hand, are classified as “shape-shifters” who have more control over the phasing ability. While a werewolf does not have a choice in their transformation, shape-shifters do. They are also not overcome with their transformation and are still able to control themselves. It may have been easier for the humans involved to call them werewolves, but there is a significant difference.

19 They Have An “Odor”
--------------------

Ask a vampire that has been near a shape-shifter, and they will describe them as one thing – smelly. While humans, like Bella, who have been around Jacob associate him with warmth, vampires are able to sense things that others cannot.

Often described as a “wet dog” aroma, it appears that a shifter’s transitioning also gives them other qualities associated with canines. Most of the Cullen family are disgusted after Bella has been around Jacob because they cannot stand the smell . After Bella transitions in to a vampire, she automatically realizes what the Cullens have been talking about. As no other Black family member is mentioned to have this aroma, it is possible that it is just Jacob. The only question that remains is, do the wolves ever bathe themselves to get rid of the smell?

18 Taylor Lautner Was Almost Recast
---------------------------------

When Taylor Lautner was cast as Jacob Black in the initial _Twilight_film, long-time fans were concerned. Jacob famously bulked up in _New Moon_, so fans were concerned. It also appears that producers felt the same way, as Lautner was almost recast before filming began.

While Lautner certainly had the personality to play Jacob, there was a concern that he would not be able to bulk up in time. However, he took this as a challenge and significantly changed his physique to match his character. It’s now difficult to see anyone but Lautner in the role. Thankfully, he was able to rise to the occasion and become what fans expected.

17 They’re Not Very Good At Keeping Their Secret
----------------------------------------------

Living life as a shape-shifting tribe must be very difficult, as that is a very large secret to hold on to. Thankfully the Quileute tribe has their own reservation where they are able to live freely without fear of their secret being unraveled. However, not all of the Quileute members are concerned with keeping the secret tightly under wraps.

When Jacob fears that he is losing Bella to the Cullens, he does something drastic. Jacob reveals his transformation to her father Charlie in order to expose him to the supernatural. While this is a very noble personal act, didn’t the other tribesmen take issue with Jacob revealing their secret? Furthermore, most of the tribe members are shape-shifting freely in the forests of Forks. Aren’t they concerned with hikers or drivers seeing them as they phase? It does not seem that anyone is very concerned with protecting this secret.

16 They Cannot Control Their Imprint
----------------------------------

The Quileute tribe may be able to control how often and where they phase into wolves, but they cannot control their hearts. _Twilight_introduced the world to the process of “imprinting:” an animal behavior of attachment forming. While this normally occurs between infants and parents, the wolves also use it to form life-long mate relationships.

When a male wolf imprints on someone, they are marking them as someone they want to spend their life with. A wolf has no control who they imprint upon. The act is entirely involuntary, and sometimes unwelcome. The imprinting that took place between Jacob and Renesmee still has people scratching their heads. However, the heart wants what it wants.

15 Anger Issues
-------------

Perhaps it is due to the warmth from their blood, but the Quileutes have awful tempers. In the heated environment of the _Twilight_universe, there is a lot of conflict to navigate through each day. Whether it is an impending vampire attack or a love triangle, these teenagers have a lot to deal with. Ultimately, some deal with it better than others.

Jacob and his family are shown to have very short fuses. Even when Sam is provoked by Bella – who he could easily defeat without phasing – he lashes out immediately. While their quick reactions are certainly useful in combat, their tempers need to be better managed to avoid accidents. Just ask Emily Uley.

14 Not All Of Them Are Buff
-------------------------

While Jacob Black’s buff physique is famous, not every Quileute tribesman is so lucky. Jacob’s growth into a muscle-bound teenager may have been an anomaly, as not everyone who phases experiences the same changes. Seth Clearwater is Jacob’s right-hand wolf when he begins his own pack. While Seth is certainly an agile and intelligent warrior, he does not have the same changes that Jacob does. Seth is certainly the smallest member of his pack, but he does not let that keep him from fighting.

Perhaps Jacob’s change in physique was indicative of him becoming an Alpha in his own pack. When compared to Sam Uley, Jacob is certainly of similar size and stature. However, Seth never reached that milestone and is still a Beta in the pack.

13 Wolf Pack Members Were Of Native Descent
-----------------------------------------

In an effort to remain true to the depictions of the source novel, the _Twilight_producers should be commended for their efforts. When casting the Black, Uley, and Quileute families, they sought to cast actors with Native lineage. While other movies have struggled to do so and wound up casting “ethnic -looking” actors, the producers stood by their ruling. In fact, each actor had to prove their lineage prior to being cast in the film series.

Other films studios and productions have been accused of “white-washing” roles in the past, this is not the case here. Actors like Chaske Spencer (Sam Uley) and Julia Jones (Leah Clearwater) were detemined to be of Native descent before being cast. Not only did the actors wind up being perfect for the roles, but they added diversity to the films.

12 Lots Of Clothes Shopping
-------------------------

While the Black family cannot technically enter the town of Forks, they hopefully have access to a Walmart. Each time that a shape-shifter phases in the _Twilight_series their clothes are almost always torn to shreds. If their clothing is destroyed each time they transform, it begs the question: exactly how much clothing do they go through each week?

A good pair of pants and a nice shirt do not come cheap, so to think that the packs are destroying clothing so easily seems irresponsible. Perhaps they should be removing it all before transforming? Or at least purchase three-packs of cheap t-shirts so that they are not ruining good quality clothing.

11 Not Everyone Phases
--------------------

While it would be great if each member of the Quileute tribe were given the chance to be shape-shifters, that is not the case. Most people would love the ability to transform into a wolf at will, but not everyone is blessed that way. Jacob explains that the shape-shifting ability is triggered when enemies are nearby. With the influx of vampires entering Forks to battle the Cullens, Jacob and other members of his family phased for the first time. However, there were not always vampires present nearby, so other members of the family never changed.

For instance, Jacob’s own father never got the opportunity to transform, and numerous other men on the reserve are not shown transforming. If every single person were chosen to receive a superpower, it wouldn’t be super anymore.

10 Rebecca Black, the lost sister
-------------------------------

This Rebecca Black isn’t singing about “Friday”, but rather about how her family left her out of all the secrets about their tribe. Rebecca Black is not mentioned in the _Twilight_films, but Jacob does discuss her in the books. Rebecca is Jacob’s older sister who moved off the reservation to attend school. While this is not discouraged, it did leave her out of some happenings in the family.

Jacob and Rebecca’s father Billy is clearly aware of the shape-shifter gene in his family as he is able to take care of Jacob as he phases. However, he did not inform his daughter about it, and she is seemingly left in the dark about this fact. With all the battles going in in Forks, Rebecca is never aware of any of them.

9 Jacob Was Almost Just A ThrowAway Character
--------------------------------------------

It would be very difficult to imagine the _Twilight_series without the Team Edward and Team Jacob love triangle. However, Edward’s affections for Bella were almost unopposed. Stephenie Meyer herself has stated that when writing _New Moon_that she struggled with what to do with Jacob. Initially, she only intended for him to be a plot device that informed Bella about the legend of vampires.

If Meyer had her way initially, Jacob’s introduction in chapter six of _Twilight_would have been his entrance and exit in the universe. However, based on feedback from her family and her own feelings as time went on, she decided to include Jacob in the book in a bigger way. His role was changed from a minor character to major one, and he even found his into Bella’s heart by the second book.

8 Billy Black Never Phased
-------------------------

Imagine how difficult it must be to be the only human around supernatural beings? While most readers would associate this statement with Bella Swan, it also applies to Billy Black. The patriarch of the Black family is wheel-chair bound due to his battle with diabetes. Not only is he unable to walk due to his disease, but he also never experiencing phasing during his youth. Meanwhile, his son Jacob wound up becoming an Alpha of his own pack.

While phasing is triggered by the arrival of enemies in the area, it must have been a bitter pill for Billy to swallow that he would never phase like his son. Regardless of his own status, Billy remains a supportive father to Jacob after he phases and continues to guide him.

7 Leah Clearwater: Female Shapeshifter
-------------------------------------

When fans picture a shape-shifter, they likely picture someone like Jacob Black – tall, dark, and handsome. More importantly, they likely picture shape-shifters as males. However, there is one female shape-shifter in Quileute history. Leah Clearwater is introduced as a fighter in Sam’s pack, and the first female to begin phasing. Leah is a very fierce and formidable fighter, and loyal to her pack like the rest of her brothers.

Unfortunately, very little is explored about her experiences as a woman in a male-dominated life. Perhaps it does explain her fierce demeanor and why she is rather emotionally guarded. Throughout the various battles that the pack faces, Leah is in the thick of things and should not be treated any differently than the other members of the tribe.

6 No Super-healing Abilities
---------------------------

The shape-shifters are certainly some of the most formidable fighters in the _Twilight_universe. Whether they are battling full-grown vampires or feisty newborns, they not only able to hold their own, but they take command of the battlefield. However, they get be wounded like regular humans.

While vampires have the ability to heal themselves from injuries quickly, shape-shifters don’t have a strong healing factor. When Jacob fights Victoria during _Eclipse_he is thrown against a rock in wolf-form and winds up with broken ribs. While Edward would have been able to power through this injury and heal himself quickly, Jacob is rendered incapacitated. In fact, he is heard writhing in pain when healing following the battle. Wolves may be superior fighters, but they are able to be put down much easier than their foes.

5 They’re Not Good With Romance
------------------------------

Most of the romances depicted in the _Twilight Saga_do not end in happiness. Beyond Edward and Bella, most of the other romances are either filled with heartbreak or even violence. Especially when they involve members of the Quileute tribe.

The love triangle between Edward, Bella, and Jacob ends in Jacob experiencing heartbreak. The relationship between Sam and Leah is broken when Sam imprints on Emily, and the romance is further complicated when Sam accidentally phases and harms Emily. The only model relationship involving a Quileute tribe member was Billy and his wife Sarah, who passed away from a car accident.

4 The Blacks and The Cullens were once allies
--------------------------------------------

The Quileute legend involving the treaty between the Natives and the “Cold Ones” is the catalyst for relationship between the Cullens and the Blacks. However, the relationship was initially built on trust and ended up devolving into hatred.

A wolf pack led by Ephraim Black came across a group of vampires, who wound up being the Cullens. To ensure that the two groups did not decimate each other for no reason, they formed a treaty. The Cullens would not attack humans, and The Quileute would stay out of their way if obeyed the treaty. It also stated that they could not reveal the other group’s secrets to humans. Initially, this pact was made to benefit everyone and was based on trust. However, as years went on it would turn in to a heated battle, with future Blacks growing up to despise vampires instead of trusting them like their ancestors.

3 Jacob Breaks The Treaty
------------------------

Speaking of the treaty, Jacob is a little to quick to blame the Cullens for almost breaking it. The treaty states that the two groups cannot reveal their secrets to others, so the vampire and shape-shifter worlds can remain safely guarded. While Jacob and his family are concerned about Bella becoming involved with Edward, the way that they go about trying to break them apart is nefarious.

Jacob is actually the first person to go against the treaty, not the Cullens. When he approaches Bella at her prom and gives her warning from his father to stay away from Edward, he hints that they are not what she thinks they are. While he does not directly point out that Edward is a vampire, he points her in that direction. This could be seen as him breaking the treaty first.

2 Jacob Imprints On A Half-Human
-------------------------------

While not many people fully understand the process of imprinting, it is a symbolically beautiful act. Emotionally and spiritually linking to another person for life is a most selfless act. However, Jacob’s imprinting is not exactly the most wholesome in the series. When Jacob first lays eyes on the newborn Renesmee, he feels directly connected with her on a different level. While the emotions are directly related to a physical relationship, it is confusing for those involved, especially her parents.

While that is understandable, it is also confusing for the rest of Jacob’s family. This is the first time that a shape-shifter has imprinted on a half-human, so this relationship is strange for everyone involved. Even though nothing has been explored about the events following _Breaking Dawn_, fans hope that this relationship eventually got less strange for everyone involved.

1 Actual Quileute Tribe Stories Were Used
----------------------------------------

Not only should the _Twilight_series be commended for casting Native actors for these roles, but they also maintained as much authenticity as possible. A universe containing shape-shifters and vampires may not be considered the most believable, but many pieces were taken from reality. Stephenie Meyer did a lot of research regarding Quileute legends before writing about her characters. Many of the stories told about the Quileute tribe are derived from actual tribal legends.

While the stories about “the Cold Ones” were embellished, the legend about the Quileute being descendants of wolves was a real legend. The background of the tribal legends makes the characters even more interesting, particularly as it gives the supernatural evidence some grounding in our reality.

Batwoman TV Show Breakdowns Tease Potential DC Characters,"

The premiere of The CW’s _**Batwoman** _may still be a ways away, but the show’s characters have potentially been revealed. Staring with _Arrow _in 2012, The CW has released a significant amount of superhero-related content over the past few years, including _The Flash, __DC’s Legends of Tomorrow_, _Black Lightning, _and_ __Supergirl. _Now, the character Kate Kane (aka Batwoman) will be getting her own show in 2019 starring Ruby Rose.

_Batwoman_will debut on the annual _Arrowverse_crossover event, titled “Elseworlds,” but will then receive her own show in 2019. With the show not even having a release date just yet, all eyes are on “Elseworlds” for details about the new version of Batwoman. The “Elseworlds” crossover will stretch across three nights with _Arrow, Flash, _and _Supergirl _each adding a new chapter to the “Elseworlds” story. So far, fans have gotten their first look at Rose as Batwoman, as well as footage of Batwoman in the crossover event, but now fans have possibly been introduced to some of the characters from the _Batwoman _spin-off show.

**Related: Arrowverse Elseworlds Poster: The Heroes Team Up With Batwoman**

According to _The Hashtag Show_, The CW is currently casting characters for _Batwoman_. While the names of these characters are relatively generic, _The Hashtag Show _may have cracked the code to the real identities of these characters based on character breakdowns for the show. The CW is supposedly casting for Kate Kane’s father Jake, Kate’s twin sister Alice, Lucius Fox’s son, the superhero Flamebird, and Flamebird’s mother. While The CW is currently casting the show, these characters are only rumored for now since _The Hashtag Show _is simply speculating on the real identities of these cover names.

While all eyes will likely be on Batwoman in the “Elseworlds” crossover event, there are other major DC characters playing a role in the event. Besides the obvious Arrow, Flash, and Supergirl, Superman will also return for “Elseworlds,” and Elizabeth Tulloch will also be introduced as Lois Lane. Although Batman won’t be making an appearance in the _Arrowverse_crossover, the event will address Batman’s absence.

Even though this news doesn’t give any concrete information pertaining to **_Batwoman_**, it confirms the fact that The CW is currently casting for the show. Fans were initially skeptical about Rose as Batwoman, but if these characters end up being included in the show, it could potentially get a lot more people on board for the series. As for now, fans can just look forward to seeing Batwoman in the “Elseworlds” crossover when it finally premieres.

The Hollywood Foreign Press Association has revealed its movie, TV show, and limited series nominations for the 2019 **Golden Globes** ceremony. The nominees were announced by Terry Crews, Danai Gurira, Leslie Mann, and Christian Slater on Thursday morning, December 6.

While there’s still a ways to go until next year’s Academy Awards ceremony, several films have already emerged as front-runners in this year’s awards season derby. Bradley Cooper’s _A Star is Born_and Yorgos Lanthimos’ _The Favourite_are among the movies near the front of the pack, as are critical darlings like Alfonso Cuarón’s _Roma_, Peter Farrelly’s _Green Book_, and Barry Jenkins’ _If Beale Street Could Talk_. At the same time, acclaimed films that opened in theaters earlier this year (namely, Ryan Coogler’s _Black Panther_and Spike Lee’s _BlacKkKlansman_) will remain in the race to the Oscars, however things play out at the Golden Globes.

**Related: Andy Samberg &amp; Sandra Oh to Host 2019 Golden Globes**

Meanwhile, on the TV front, HBO’s _Sharp Objects_and AMC’s _The Little Drummer Girl_limited series adaptations are expected to earn their fair share of recognition from the awards shows to come, starting with the Golden Globes. Brand-new TV shows likes HBO’s _Barry_and BBC America’s _Killing Eve_have already been widely celebrated and recognized by awards bodies this year, and should only continue to rack up more nominations from here. The same goes for the celebrated sophomore seasons of returning comedies like FX’s _Atlanta_(aka. _Atlanta: Robbin’ Season_) and Netflix’s _GLOW_– though, the muted response to HBO’s _Westworld_season 2 may hurt its own awards season prospects.

Something I realized about a throwaway gag in Groundhog Day,"Here's the clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKvT1laennU

The throwaway gag is that Phil has bought all of this insurance because, not only will he never collect, but he'll never have to make a payment. Ha-ha. He bought insurance he'll never need or pay for.

But I realized today that there is more to it than that.

Earlier in the film, we see Phil condescend to Ned Ryerson, assault him, and even (pretend to) come on to him to make him feel creeped out. At some point during Phil's  . . . stay, he must have started going in different directions to explore his contained universe and so began avoiding Ned by either default or design. Yet, at least on his final day, Phil went back to meeting Ned on the street. Once again, he could have done anything he wanted to this annoying dweeb, but on this day, he gave Ned, in Ned's words ""the best day of my life."" The scene itself would appear to exist as just an excuse for one more gag, but it also shows that, even for people that Phil doesn't necessarily like, he still tries to make their lives better and showing in one more way his true evolution into an enlightened person.",MovieDetails,1544198866,Jackieirish,True,1,28,2018-12-07

"Looking for inspiration. I'm trying to get an idea, an image if you will. Of a cop/detective/criminal falling in love with his partners wife/girlfriend.","I dont know if this is where i should post this but, here we go.

Im trying to write a scene where a detective falls in love and has an affair with his partners wife. I just cant really write something believable. Something where you feel the love and the passion between the two where there is nothing left to do but give in to their undying attraction to one another.

I want to write something where you as the viewer/reader know its wrong but you come to terms with it and okay it.  

So what im asking for is a few movie recommendations that have done this that i can take notes from. 

Its not really my kind of movies, but pretty sure its been done before.

TL;DR: looking for movies where a detective/cop/criminal falls in love with his partners wife.

"In The Dark Knight, Harvey Dent represents being half Batman and half Joker","For the first half of the movie, Harvey Dent has his Batman side show as he is fighting criminals and working toward a safer Gotham which is what Batman is fighting for. In a way, he starts out the film as Batman, except his fighting is lot more legal and political than using fists.

Halfway through the film, Dent gets blown up which is when his Joker side comes out. Now he is chaotic and destructive not unlike the Joker himself.

You could say that both Batman and the Joker are just different sides of the same coin (not unlike Harvey's two headed coin) where in the Joker's point that everyone has chaos and destruction inside them and that all it takes is a ""push"", pushing the coin over to show the other, darker, damaged side of humanity we all have inside of us.

At the end of the film we see Dent get knocked off the edge of the construction site and fall to his death. This meant that for the Joker to be defeated, Batman had to sacrifice his side of the coin as well, as after the film Batman goes into hiding and is not seen again for years.

And for good measure, when Joker gets his half of the mob's money, he only burns ""his half"". Which he also did with ""his half"" of Harvey Dent, quite literally burning half of his face off.",MovieDetails,1541726934,SteveOMatt,True,1,12,2018-11-08

Why she was named Charlie in Hereditary and other binge catches,"After binging on the movie the past two weeks, there were a few additional tidbits i found interesting that I thought I could share.

* When Annie opened the boxes filled with her late mother's possessions, she came across two of the embroidered door mats, one for her and one for ""Charles"", which we can assume was her brother who killed himself. The daughter Charlie's name not only insinuates that she should have been a boy, but also she was named after a young man who killed himself.
* The voice of the art director on the voicemail is actually the Director, Ari Aster.
* Almost all of the attendance at Charlie's funeral were the cult members that were at Ellen's wake.
* ""The Fun Song"" by Flatbush Zombies was playing at the party that Charlie and Peter went to... in the middle of Utah. This song was from an obscure mixtape from a local Brooklyn based rap group from 2012.

&gt;Aeschylus’s Agamemnon is a tragedy that was first performed in Athens in 458 BC, basically deals with one of the dark stories of hereditary guilt....

&gt;Agamemnon is killed partly for his own guilt and partly for his father’s guilt. So a parent’s guilt visits the son and the son has to suffer for the sin committed by the father. In this way ‘hereditary guilt’ travels through generation involving a serious of murder. The consequence of one’s guilt gives rise to another and the fire of Nemesis never dies. The killer must be killed is the dictum of justice.

2)In the photo where CIA’s team is shown all the soldiers eyes are blacked out, but you can see Henry Cavill on the left.

3)When they are discussing the plan to extract Lane with the widow, while giving Lane’s background they cut the scene to Henry Cavill when he mentions”he recruits Rouge Assassins”(Foreshadowing the twist)

4)This one is more of a mistake, in the scene when Henry realizes that its actually Pegg wearing a mask, he tears it  and Pegg speaks with his voice and not Lane’s.

David has a fairly square jaw, because Bruce Willis, and the way that Elijah has his hair in the film makes it seem like he has a disproportionately [big head.](https://d13ezvd6yrslxm.cloudfront.net/wp/wp-content/images/ZZ241666C0-700x300.jpg)",MovieDetails,1523454452,TheInitialGod,True,70,8,2018-04-11

Bilbo’s reaction to the ring in Rivendell,"Bilbo in the first movie when he sees the ring in Rivendell his face changes to resemble Gollum’s for a fraction of a second but it begs the question why that face? Was it purely a directing choice to choose the features that resemble an addict and apply it to both characters or is it possible that it has some connection to Sauron’s past? (which genuinely I don’t know and any information about it would be helpful)

A subtle clue that sh*t is about to hit the fan in in Forrest Gump.,"I only noticed this recently while rewatching Forrest Gump. Right before sh*t hits the fan in Vietnam, we watch a tranquil montage about the rainy season. It ends somewhat abruptly when the rain finally stops, followed by an immediate ambush by the other side, cueing the start of the battle. First time I watched it, it totally surprised me. 

However, there's a song playing in the background right before they're attacked. The song is Buffalo Springfield's - For What Its Worth. The lyrics you hear are:

""There's something happening here.
What it is ain't exactly clear.
There's a man with a gun over there
Telling me I got to beware.""

And technically if the song were to continue over the sudden gunfire, the lyrics would continue like this. 

""I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound?
Everybody look what's going down?""

There's no way the editors didn't put that there on purpose. It went right over my head the first few times since I didn't know the song very well. If I had known that song at the time of my first watch, I think I would have seen that ambush coming.

IT (2017) - The way a character is saved near the end of the film is foreshadowed in a much earlier scene (Major Spoilers in post),"Once again I am going to reiterate that this post contains major plot spoilers of the film IT so do NOT read any further if you have not seen the movie.



So near the end of the movie, Beverley has been taken by Pennywise and after trying to scare her, she tells him that she is not afraid. This causes Pennywise to make her float and Bev is put under some kind of spell. The Loser Club finds Beverly, pulls her down, they try to wake her up but nothing works. Ben, in his wisdom, decides to kiss her, which breaks the spell and she is saved.

When we first see Beverly's apartment, the first shot of her room has what looks like a keyboard (I could be wrong) and sitting on it is a green book with the title 'The Frog Prince'. In this story, it is a prince who is under a spell and transformed into a frog and the only way to break the spell is a kiss from a princess.

I understand the original brother's Grimm story is slightly different but most people will know this version of the story. And also that the genders are swapped, but still think it was a cool addition by the filmmakers to choose that particular book to have in her room.",MovieDetails,1505421799,rossatron688,True,53,8,2017-09-14

"In Ant-Man, Luis' storytelling is written off as comedic relief nonsense when it actually revealed his suspicions of it being the exact type of tip Scott was looking to avoid","I apologize if this was obvious, but I own the movie and have watched it a half dozen times, and only did I just watch it with subtitles and correctly understand what Luis was saying. 

Luis' shtick in the film is his meandering retelling of stories, and how they frame it by ""reenacting"" other characters telling the story *word for word* and in sync with Luis' cadence and voice -- so I just wrote off his first ""tip"" as a comedic relief and comedically long exposition to merely pass on a simple tip -- ***when in fact his retelling implies Luis' own suspicions that it was a trap all along and what Scott was looking to avoid.***

Scott doesn't ask *WHAT* the tip is so much as he asks *WHERE* the tip came from because he wanted to make sure it was ""airtight"" in origin and chain of custody, i.e. that it was reliable and neither a trap nor a sting nor a failed rumor. Luis implied the chain of custody was suspect but Scott was too confused to catch that. So was I. 

I only just realized this in the first place due to mishearing his fast storytelling, because I always thought he said

&gt; of course I ask him (Ernesto) to ask Emily to ask Carlos to tell you (Scott) to get to me (Luis) what kind of safe it was

***which never made any sense to me***. 

Why would Carlos tell Scott anything?

Why would Scott be telling Luis anything in Luis' own story?

**I thought was sort of the point, to show that Luis' story is confusing as hell**, with most of it *nonsense* and only a sliver of it actually *material* (there's a safe). 

This notion is reinforced by Scott's confusion, insistence that Luis tell a less confusing story, and lack of suspicion is boiled down to two simple sentences by Scott (there's a safe, let's just work with that). No one but Luis is suspicious, no questioning by Scott. 

But in actuality, with subtitles on to break down Peña's fast talking**^1** his story is not only clear but it reveals a suspect trap and Luis' suspicion of Emily laying it, as this is what Luis said

&gt; of course I ask him (Ernesto), ""**Did Emily ask Carlos to tell you (Ernesto) to get to me what kind of safe it was?""**

Luis isn't just suspicious, but specifically suspicious of what Scott is specifically looking for -- a suspect chain of custody of the tip (why would Emily tell Carlos to tell Ernesto about the safe?), as it was too coincidental for it to travel from across the bay and to Luis and Scott, and was thus a trap. 

But Scott says ""there's a safe, we know where it is, let's just work with that."" Scott isn't suspicious at all, yet he should have been. 

Of course, luis' suspicion was confirmed by Hank when he says he paid off Emily to tell Carlos to tell Ernesto -- exactly Luis' concern. But I always thought this was a *reveal*, not a *confirmation* of something prior. 

Luis was right all along not only in his specific suspicions of Emily, but in being suspicious at all. 

**TLDR -- Luis' hilarious retelling of stories, particular the first one, is seen as comedic relief nonsense when it actually served to show that Luis was actually competently suspicious of his own tip being the type of trap Scott was looking to avoid, but like Scott, I couldn't fully understand Luis' fast talk, which serves , until I used subtitles and realized Luis was saying completely different things. Scott never got it and thus fell into  Hank's trap.**

PS -- this would explain why Scott (and the audience) isn't suspicious of the tip...he never understood Luis well enough to be suspicious. 


**^1**

Peña spoke so (comedically) fast and I always assumed that he said in a contracted rhythm, ""I ask him to ask Emily to ask Carlos..."" when in reality it was ""I ask him, 'Did Emily ask Carlos...'"" 

It sounded like a contraction of phrases, like ""to ask Emily to ask Carlos"" sounding like ""t'ask Emily t'ask Carlos"" instead of ""did Emily ask Carlos."" (If you say it really fast it really does sound like it, and Peña spoke really fast)

Which changes the entire meaning of his story and reveals him asking why Emily told Carlos to tell his cousin about the safe.

"In Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory, the fake golden ticket was found by a Nazi.","In Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory, the last ticket was found by a man in Paraguay located in South America. Its later revealed that the ticket is a fake. During the initial news report on finding the last ticket the news station in Paraguay shows the following photo:


http://i.imgur.com/t6HNWHY.jpg


Here is the actual scene (unfortunately I could only find a comical cut of the scene):


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnNFG7da6lo


And when the ticket is found to be a fraud, the same picture is used in the newspaper:


http://i.imgur.com/qWSURvf.jpg


Here is the actual photo and the man photographed is actually Nazi Martin Bormann and head of the Nazi Party Chancellery. 


http://i.imgur.com/462sAPm.jpg


Some background on who Martin Bormann is and why he might have been featured as the owner of the fake ticket. Martin Bormann was not found after the war unlike pretty much all the top Nazi leadership (none of the actual top Nazi leadership escaped to South America like a lot of the stories of the time were telling people, it was lower level SS officers and officials that managed to pull that off). By the end of the war Martin Bormann was probably the most powerful man in the Nazi party because he controlled the information going in and out of Hitlers hands. He was also not that well known to the Allies as he wasn't featured in most of the Nazi propaganda. Martin Bormann was in the Fuhrerbunker in the final days of the war and was part of the breakout groups that tried to escape Berlin after Hitler killed himself. Artur Axmann the leader of the Nazi Youth Party claimed and told the Allies that he saw Martin Bormanns as well as Dr. Ludwig Stumpfegger bodies near the Invalidienstrasse bridge which led to the Lehrter Bahnhof (now Berlin Hauptbahnhof) train station. Artur Axmann claims that he left the Fuhrerbunker with both Bormann and Stumpfegger but decided to take an alternate path, he encountered a Russian patrol and double backed where he claimed to have seen the lifeless bodies of Bormann and Stumpfegger. Later on the area that Artur Axmann claimed to have seen the bodies was excavated but no bodies were found. A retired postal worker named Albert Krumnow as well as his colleague claimed they were ordered by a Russian patrol to bury two bodies located near the description that Artur Axmann gave. His colleague was able to find identifying information on one of the bodies as Dr. Ludwig Stumpfegger and relayed this information to Dr. Ludwig Stumpfegger's widow. Eventually, in 1972 construction was being performed near Lehrter Bahnof and two bodies were found. Through the basic forensic evidence of the time they were able to determine that the one body was Martin Bormanns, his body was not allowed to be cremated in the event that later forensic science would be able to conclusively determine that the body was indeed Martin Bormanns body. In 1998 the DNA of a close relative was matched against the DNA pulled from the skull, the body was 100% the body of Martin Bormann, his remains were cremated by the family in 1999.


My best guess to why hes featured is like most children's movies. Most of know that when you go back and watch a children's movie or television show as an adult you see jokes that as a kid you never understood or went right over your head. The creators like to put adult humor into their creations because they know adults will also be watching them. My best guess is that the director/producer of Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory or maybe a production artist thought it would be funny to use the photo of Martin Bormann. Mainly because Martin Bormann is the reason we have so many ""did this &lt;insert Nazi name&gt; escape to South America?"" stories. Martin Bormann as long as several other highly publicized incidents are the reason we have those rumors and stories. At the time of production of Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory (1970/1971), the body of Martin Bormann had not been found. So this would be one of the details that a child watching the movie at the time wouldn't notice but the adult who brought him to the theater would catch.
